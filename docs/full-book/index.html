<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Smithsonian in Washington, DC is one of the largest museums in the world, with vast collections of rare and historically significant objects.</p>
<p>For example, it houses the <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/nasm_A19610048000">1903 Wright Flyer</a> and the <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/nasm_A19700102000">Apollo 11 Module</a> in the Air and Space collection.</p>
<p>In other collections you might find <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/nmah_1199660">Abraham Lincoln’s top hat</a>, an original <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/nmah_765593">Kermit the Frog</a> puppet, or the <a href="https://www.si.edu/spotlight/hope-diamond">Hope Diamond</a>. In total, the Smithsonian has more than 200 million fossils, specimens and treasures.</p>
<p>These collections help preserve our nation’s history and culture and are invaluable to researchers and scientists.</p>
<p>Collections are also important in math, although you seldom find them in a museum.</p>
<h2 id="sets">Sets</h2>
<p>In mathematics, collections are usually called <strong>sets</strong>.  Sets are the foundational building blocks of modern mathematics.</p>
<p>To create a set, you simply need a way to decide if an object belongs to the set or not.</p>
<p>One way to do that is to list everything in the set. For example, we know that traffic lights have three colors: red, yellow, and green. We can list these colors to form a set: $\lbrace \text{red, yellow, green} \rbrace$.  Sets are always written with curly braces $\lbrace \thinspace \thinspace \rbrace$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/set_colors.svg#center" alt="the set of colors on a traffic light"></p>
<p>Another way to represent a set is by drawing a diagram.  This is done by making a big circle and then writing each item of the set inside this circle.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/set_colors_diagram.svg#center" alt="the set of colors on a traffic light"></p>
<p>Visual diagrams like this will be very helpful in later sections where we investigate relationships between sets.</p>
<h2 id="set-builder-notation">Set-Builder Notation</h2>
<p>Sometimes it's hard to list everything in a set.  For instance, <em>whiskers on kittens</em>, <em>bright copper kettles</em> and <em>warm woolen mittens</em> might be a few of my favorite things, but listing all my favorites would be impossible.</p>
<p>Luckily, we can describe sets using words rather than listing everything inside them.  This is called <strong>set-builder notation</strong>.</p>
<p>Using set-builder notation, &quot;all of my favorite things&quot; would be written as</p>
<p>[
\left\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is one of my favorite things} \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>The vertical bar symbol $\vert$ is shorthand for &quot;such that&quot; or &quot;where&quot;.  If we put the set above into words we would read it as &quot;the set of all $x$ <em>where</em> $x$ is one of my favorite things.&quot;</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>
<p>Is $\text{Apple, Orange, Banana}$ a valid set?<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Almost.  While it is a list of objects, it does not have the right format.  To be written as a set it should be surrounded by curly braces.  The correct way to write it is $\lbrace \text{apple, orange, banana} \rbrace$.</details></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are $\lbrace \text{Taco, Cat, Goat, Cheese, Pizza} \rbrace$ and $\lbrace \text{Pizza, Cheese, Goat, Cat, Taco} \rbrace$ the same set?<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Yes, they are the same. In sets, the order of elements doesn't matter.</details></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the set $\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is something in your backpack} \rbrace$ in words and list a few items that might be in it.<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />This is &quot;the set of all $x$ where $x$ is something in your backpack&quot;.  Elements in this set could include note paper, a pencil, a calculator, etc.</details></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the set of all vegetables using set-builder notation.<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />$\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is a vegetable} \rbrace$</details></p>

<h2 id="combining-sets">Combining Sets</h2>
<p>Sets can be combined in two different ways. The first way is to group everything from both sets together into one big set.  This is called the <strong>union</strong> of the two sets.  In the figure below you can form the union of the two sets by moving the <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> slider.</p>
<div class="no-print geogebra" style="padding-top: 20%;margin-bottom:0.5rem; ">

</div>
<p>There is a special symbol we use for unions: $\bigcup$.  If we have two sets, $A$ and $B$, then we write their union as $A \bigcup B$</p>
<p>[
A \bigcup B = \left\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is in } A  \text{ or }  x \text{ is in }B  \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>The second way to combine sets is to only consider items that the two sets have in common. This is called the <strong>intersection</strong> of the sets.</p>
<div class="no-print geogebra" style="padding-top: 20%;margin-bottom:0.5rem; ">

</div>
<p>The intersection of two sets also has its own symbol: $\bigcap$.</p>
<p>[
A \bigcap B = \left\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is in } A  \text{ and }  x \text{ is in }B\ \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>If the intersection has nothing in it we say it is <em>empty</em> and use the symbol $\varnothing$ to represent the <strong>empty set</strong>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Consider the following sets
[
\begin{align}
A &amp;= \lbrace \text{flour, sugar, butter, eggs, milk} \rbrace \newline

</li>
<li>
<p>List all the elements of $A \bigcap B$. <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Since intersection is only the items that the two sets have in common, $A \bigcap B$ would contain just eggs and milk.</br></br></details></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe $B\bigcap C$. <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The sets have nothing in common so their intersection is the empty set.

<h2 id="counting">Counting</h2>
<p>It might be hard to imagine, but people have not always had numbers. The numbers we use today are actually the result of thousands of years of innovation and invention.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, sets actually come before numbers. To see why this is the case, take a look at the following sets.  What do they have in common?</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/sets_of_3.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>These sets are similar because they are the same size.  Even though their contents are different, the <em>quantity</em> of items in each set is identical.  In other words, they have the same <strong>number</strong> of items.</p>
<p>It's this need to count the objects in a set that sparked the development of numbers.</p>
<h2 id="development-of-numbers">Development of Numbers</h2>
<p>There's little doubt that fingers were among the earliest counting tools.  In fact, the English the words <em>eleven</em> and <em>twelve</em> come from the Old English words for &quot;one left over&quot; and &quot;two left over&quot;, indicating how many would be left over after counting to ten with your fingers.</p>
<p>Over time people invented other ways to keep track of their flocks, herds, and other commodities.  They used tally marks on sticks, made piles of pebbles, and even carved figurines to look like sheep, goats, jars of oil, baskets of grain, and so on.

<p>In Mesopotamia, about 10,000 years ago, the Sumerians began making clay tokens shaped to resemble the items they were exchanging, one token for each item.  Soon these tokens were replaced by shapes drawn on clay tablets.</p>
<p>Eventually special symbols, or <em>numerals</em>, were created to represent specific quantities. It was at that point, some 5000 years ago, that the first number system was born.

<span class="sidenote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/Sumerian_tablet.png" alt=""> This 5000 year-old clay tablet is one of the first artifacts in history to display numerical symbols.  It records how much beer should be paid to a particular worker for his labor. <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=327218&amp;partId=1">Photo courtesy of the British Museum</a> </span></p>
<p>The Sumerian system did not look like the one we use today.  They counted using groups of 60 (which is why we have 60 minutes in an hour) and used different symbols than what we are used to.</p>
<p>The number system we use today originally came from India and was later adopted by Arab scholars. That's why we call it the Hindu-Arabic system.</p>
<p>It took until the 15th and 16th centuries for Europe to start using Hindu-Arabic numerals. Since then, this system has spread worldwide through colonization, trade, and scholarly communication.</p>
<h2 id="natural-numbers-and-integers">Natural Numbers and Integers</h2>
<p>The numbers we are most familiar with are the counting numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, ...$.</p>
<p>The set of counting numbers is also known as the <strong>natural numbers</strong> and is represented by the symbol $\mathbb{N}$. In set notation we would say</p>
<p>[
\mathbb{N} = \left\lbrace 1,2,3,...\right\rbrace

<p>You might already know that when we add two natural numbers the result is also a natural number. For example, $3$ and $5$ are both natural numbers and so is $3+5=8$.</p>
<p>But what if we subtract one natural number from another, is the result always in $\mathbb{N}$?  Clearly not, since subtraction can result in negative values.</p>
<p>The set that combines $\mathbb{N}$ with $0$ and all the negative natural numbers $ \left\lbrace ..., -3, -2, \right\rbrace$ is called the set of <strong>integers</strong> and is represented by the symbol $\mathbb{Z}$.</p>
<p>[
\mathbb{Z} = \left\lbrace ...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,... \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>We can add and subtract integers as much as we like and the result will always be an integer.</p>

<h2 id="rational-numbers">Rational Numbers</h2>
<p>While multiplying two integers always results in another integer, division is more complicated.</p>
<p>If $p$ and $q$ are integers, then the fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ could be an integer, but it doesn't have to be. For instance $\frac{6}{2}=3$ is an integer, but $\frac{5}{2}$ is not.</p>
<p>The set that contains all the fractions, or ratios, of integers, is called the set of <strong>rational numbers</strong>, or $\mathbb{Q}$.</p>
<p>[
\mathbb{Q} = \left\lbrace \frac{p}{q}  \thinspace \bigg|  \thinspace {p} \text{ and } {q} \text{ are integers with } q\neq0 \right\rbrace.
]</p>
<p>Since division by $0$ is not well defined, ratios like $\frac{4}{0}$ and $\frac{-2}{0}$ are undefined and not included in the set of rational numbers.</p>
<p>Also notice that since any integer can be written as a fraction, the set of rational numbers includes all of the integers.</p>
<p>Rational numbers may be written as fractions or as decimals. The decimal expansion of a rational number will either terminate or eventually have a pattern that repeats forever, as these examples illustrate:
[
\begin{align}
\frac{3}{16} &amp;=0.1875 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal terminates}} \newline \newline
\frac{1}{3} &amp;=0.\overline{3} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal repeats}} \newline \newline
\frac{1}{7} &amp;=0.\overline{142857} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal repeats}} \newline \newline
\frac{10}{5} &amp;=2 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal terminates}}
\end{align}
]
The set of rational numbers is special because you can add, subtract, multiply and divide as much as you want and never end up with a different type of number---the answer will always be a rational number.</p>

<h2 id="real-numbers">Real Numbers</h2>
<p>Since the rational numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, it might come as a surprise that other types of numbers exist and are essential to mathematics.  The discovery of one new type of number is attributed to an associate of Pythagoras whose name was Hippasus of Metapontum.</p>
<p>According to legend, Hippasus was trying to measure the diagonal of a 1 by 1 square
<label for="sn-sqrt_2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sqrt_2" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/sqrt_2.svg#center" alt=""></span>
.  He knew from the Pythagorean theorem that the answer was $\sqrt{2}$, but had been unable to find a rational number that was equal to $2$ when you square it.</p>
<p>Eventually he proved that $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be written as a ratio of any two integers and concluded that it must belong to a set of <strong>irrational numbers</strong>.</p>
<p>Some accounts say that the other Pythagoreans were so shocked by Hippasus' discovery that they drowned him in the Mediterranean Sea in an attempt to hide irrational numbers from the world.</p>
<p>Even though irrational numbers cannot be written as fractions, we can still represent them as decimals. The decimal expansion of an irrational number never ends and never repeats. For example, $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.414213562...$.</p>
<p>The union of the rational and irrational numbers is called the set of <strong>real numbers</strong>, $\mathbb{R}$.  In other words, the set of real numbers includes every type of number we've discussed so far.</p>
<p>For example, $-0.5$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\frac{7}{3}$, $-0.248$, and  $8.\overline{261}$ are all real numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/real_numbers.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The set of real numbers is closed under all standard operations including powers and some roots.  In fact, you can do just about anything to a real number and the result will still be a real number, as long as you do not take the square root of a negative value, something we will look into in a <a href="//chapter-5/5.2#imaginary-numbers">later chapter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-number-line">The Real Number Line</h2>
<p>It is often helpful to visualize the set of real numbers with a <strong>number line</strong>, which is nothing more than a straight line with marks representing the location of numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/numberline_plain.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Positive numbers are always on the right side of zero, negative numbers are always on the left, and arrows indicate that the line continues in both directions.</p>
<p>Every real number has a place on the number line, and every location on a number line is assumed to correspond to a real number.  Here are a few real numbers and their relative locations on the number line.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/numberline_real_numbers.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="intervals-of-real-numbers">Intervals of Real Numbers</h2>
<p>The set of all values in between two numbers is called an <strong>interval</strong>.  For instance, all of the numbers between $0$ and $3$ make an interval.</p>
<p>There are several ways to describe this interval.  One way is to use inequalities and write it as a set.</p>
<p>[\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace 0&lt;x&lt;3  \rbrace]</p>
<p>Another option is to color the interval on a numberline</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/interval_open_0_to_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Open circles indicate that the numbers $0$ and $3$ are <strong>not</strong> included in the interval.</p>
<p>A third option is to use <strong>interval notation</strong>, which is a written abbreviation of the number line.  In this example the interval notation would be</p>
<p>[(0 , 3)]</p>
<p>Notice that this mirrors the number line by having the lowest number on the left, with parenthesis taking the place of the open circles.</p>
<p>Other intervals might include an end point or even extend out toward infinity.  For example, the interval of all numbers greater than or equal to $-2$ can be described in any of the following ways</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>set notation</strong>: [\lbrace x\vert-2\leq x&lt;\infty  \rbrace]</li>
<li><strong>number line</strong>: <img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/interval_closed_-2_to_infinity.svg#center" alt=""></li>
<li><strong>interval notation</strong>: [[ -2\thinspace, \thinspace \infty)]</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few subtleties here that deserved to be highlighted.</p>
<p>First, notice that there are three ways to indicate that an endpoint is included.  In set notation, the inequality used must have an equal sign ($\leq$ or $\geq$). On a number line, the circle marking the point is filled in. And in the interval notation, the parenthesis for that point changes to a square bracket.</p>
<p>Second, to indicate that an interval continues out toward infinity we use an arrow pointing in the appropriate direction.  Since nothing equals infinity we must always use a parenthesis when writing that part of the interval.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

<h2 id="combining-intervals">Combining Intervals</h2>
<p>Since intervals are sets of real numbers, they can be combined using unions and intersections.</p>
<p>As before, the union is the all of the two intervals joined together, while the intersection is just where two intervals overlap each other.  A few examples will illustrate the idea.</p>
<p>Suppose we have the following intervals.  What will the <strong>union</strong> look like?  Move the <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> slider to see the union.</p>

<h2 id="order-of-operations">Order of operations</h2>
<p>In elementary school students are often asked to add several numbers together, such as $4 + 10 + 5 = 19$.  What is seldom discussed is the fact that we can't technically add three numbers at once.</p>
<p>Addition, like the other basic operations, is a &quot;binary&quot; operation--it only works on two numbers a time.  To avoid confusion, when multiple operations are needed there is a standard order that should be followed.</p>
<p>The order of operations we use today is sometimes remembered by the acronym P E MD AS, which stands for</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>P</strong>arentheses (including brackets and fraction bars)</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>xponents (including roots)</li>
<li><strong>M</strong>ultiplication and <strong>D</strong>ivision</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>ddition and <strong>S</strong>ubtraction</li>
</ol>
<p>When several of these operations are combined, operations higher on the list should be dealt with before those lower on the list.</p>
<p>And if an expression has more than one operation with equal priority (like multiplication and division or addition and subtraction) then you work with them in the order they appear from left to right.  For instance, if we have $20 \div 5 \times 2$, then we start from the left and first do $20 \div 5$, which is $4$, and then multiply that by $2$, giving us $8$.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Each button on a vending machine corresponds to a particular snack inside the machine. The item you get depends on the button you push. When you press the button for a soda the machine should give you that soda, if it is functioning properly.</p>
<p>In this section we'll see that mathematical functions connect things in a similar way.</p>
<h2 id="the-definition-of-a-function">The Definition of a Function</h2>
<p>While no single definition can capture the full extent of the function concept, it is still important to start with one.  The following definition was developed in the early 1900's and is stated in terms of sets.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h4>DEFINITION</h4>
<p>A <strong>function</strong> is any rule that matches each element from one set to exactly one element in another set. The set of inputs is called the <strong>domain</strong> of the function while the <strong>range</strong> is the set of all its output values.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that this definition has three parts: (1) a set of inputs called the domain, (2) a set of outputs called the range and (3) the rule that links them together.</p>
<p>This is just like a vending machine where there is a set of buttons, a set of snacks, and the internal workings of the machine that link the two.</p>
<p>Perhaps a diagram would help illustrate this.  If $x$ is in the domain and $y$ is in the range, then we can draw the function as a mapping diagram, like the one below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_function_x_y.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Let's look at a specific example.  Suppose three friends went to a deli and each ordered a sandwich, as in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_sandwiches_1.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since each person is linked to just one sandwich, this <em>is</em> a function.</p>
<p>In general, anytime we can match each item from one set to just one item another set, then we have a function.</p>
<p>In the figure below you can change the arrangement of the arrows by moving the <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> points.  Experiment until you feel confident that you can recognize what is and what is not a function.</p>

<h2 id="function-notation">Function Notation</h2>
<p>When there is a function relationship between $x$ and $y$ it is common practice to replace $y$ with $f(x)$ and say that $y=f(x)$.  This is known as <strong>function notation</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_function_x_f_of_x.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>When said aloud the notation $f(x)$ is read &quot;$f$ of  $x$&quot;.  This notation reminds us that the output $f(x)$ is the result of putting the input $x$ inside of the function $f$.</p>
<p>In fact, it can be helpful to think of a function as a machine that changes an object $x$ into something new $f(x)$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/function_machine.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that pressing the button $\text{B4}$ on a vending machine gives you a bag of potato chips. Using function notation we might write $f(\text{B4})=\text{potato chips}$.</p>
<p>With function notation the choice of letters is completely arbitrary. For example, if a function always adds $3$ it makes no difference whether we refer to it as $f(x)=x+3$ or as $g(x)=x+3$ or as $w(t)=t+3$. It is what a function does that matters, not what it is called.</p>

<h2 id="evaluating--solving">Evaluating &amp; Solving</h2>
<p>The process of finding the output for a particular input is called <strong>evaluating</strong> the function. Evaluating is sometimes confused with solving, which is understandable since they are like two sides of a coin.  To <strong>evaluate</strong> we start with an input and find the output.  <strong>Solving</strong> is the reverse process, we are given an output and must find the input.</p>
<p>Perhaps seeing this in the context of our vending machine analogy will help.  Evaluating is like choosing a button on the vending machine (the input) and getting a snack (the output). Solving, on the other hand, is like knowing the snack you want and figuring out which button to press to get it.</p>
<p>Consider the function shown in the table below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$x$</th>
<th>$y=f(x)$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A2</td>
<td>chocolate bar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A3</td>
<td>bubble gum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B4</td>
<td>potato chips</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C1</td>
<td>root beer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C2</td>
<td>granola bar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3</td>
<td>pretzels</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To evaluate $f(A2)$ we simply find the value of $y$ when $x=A2$.  From the table it appears that $f(A2)=\text{chocolate bar}$.</p>
<p>To solve $f(x)=\text{root beer}$, however, we scan the table in the opposite direction, looking for an $x$ that creates $\text{root beer}$ as an output.  The solution is $x=C1$.</p>
<p>If a function is defined by an equation, such as $f(x)=2 x^2 - 6 x$, then we evaluate it by replacing every $x$ with the given input value.  To find $f(10)$, we insert $10$ everywhere we see an $x$ and simplify, if possible.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
f(10) &amp;= 2(10)^2-6(10) \newline
&amp;= 200-60 \newline
&amp;= 140
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>We now know that $f(10)=140$.</p>
<p>A function can be evaluated even if we do not get a numerical result.  Evaluating $f(x^{2})$ or $f(t+2)$ would mean substituting each $x$ with the expression $x^{2}$ or $t+2$.</p>

<h2 id="representations-of-functions">Representations of Functions</h2>
<p>Because functions are so widely used, there are many different ways to represent them.  We have already encountered functions shown by mapping diagrams and equations.  We'll also see functions written as tables, sets of points, sequences of operations, and graphs.</p>
<p>Each way to visualize a function highlights something special about the function, and switching from one to another can help us see different features and discover connections that might have been hidden otherwise.</p>
<p>Of primary importance is the connection between equations, tables and graphs.</p>
<h2 id="graphs-of-functions">Graphs of Functions</h2>
<p>The <strong>graph</strong> of a function is the set of all points $(x, y)$ where each $y$ is found by evaluating the function's equation, since $y=f(x)$.</p>
<p>For instance, to graph the function $f(x)=x^{2}-3$ we randomly choose a handful of values for $x$ and evaluate the function for each one, creating a table of values.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$x$</th>
<th>$f(x)=x^{2}-3$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$-2$</td>
<td>$(-2)^2-3 = 1$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$-1$</td>
<td>$(-1)^2-3 =  -2$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$0$</td>
<td>$(0)^2-3 = -3$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$1$</td>
<td>$(1)^2-3 = -2$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$2$</td>
<td>$(2)^2-3 = 1$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$3$</td>
<td>$(3)^2-3 = 6$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Then we convert those values into ordered $(x, y)$ pairs</p>
<p>[
\left\lbrace (-2, 1),  (-1, -2),  (0, -3),  (1, -2),  (2, 1),  (3, 6) \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>that can be plotted and connected with a smooth curve.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/function_graph_x2-3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Even though calculators and apps can graph most functions, graphing functions by hand is still an important skill to practice.</p>

<h2 id="the-vertical-line-test">The Vertical Line Test</h2>
<p>It is important to remember that not every relationship or rule defines a function.  The key is that each input corresponds to just one output.  This applies to graphs as well.</p>
<p>In order for a graph to be a function each $x$ can only correspond to one $y$.  This means that no two points on the graph can share the same $x$-coordinate.</p>
<p>A quick way to test this is to imagine drawing vertical lines across it. If any line hits the graph more than once, it's not a function. For obvious reasons, this is called the <strong>vertical line test</strong>.</p>
<p>In each of the figures below there is a <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> vertical line.  Apply the vertical line test to each graph by moving the vertical line across the graph.</p>

<h2 id="evaluate-functions-using-graphs">Evaluate Functions Using Graphs</h2>
<p>When a function is defined by a graph we evaluate the function by reading off the $y$ coordinate that matches the given $x$ value.</p>

<p>To evaluate $f(5)$, for example, move the <strong><font color="blue">INPUT</font></strong> to $x=5$ and read off the corresponding <strong><font color="red">OUTPUT</font></strong> on the $y$-axis.  In this case, $f(5)=4$.</p>
<p>So to use a graph to find a function's output, just find where your input value meets the graph. The height of that point is your answer.</p>
<p>Solving reverses the process-we find $x$ when given a specific $y$.  As an example, to solve $f(x)=4$ for $x$ you move the  <strong>INPUT</strong> until the <strong>OUTPUT</strong> equals $4$.  Then you record the <strong>INPUT</strong>.  Here there are multiple values for $x$ that work: $x=1.7$, $x=4$, and $x=11.7$ all appear to give outputs of $4$, and would be valid solutions to $f(x)=4$.</p>
<h2 id="domain-of-a-function">Domain of a Function</h2>
<p>Every time we identify a function we should also determine its domain.  Recall that the domain is like the list of buttons on a vending machine: it's all the possible input choices you have.</p>
<p>When a function is defined by a table, a diagram or a set of points, then we can list each individual thing in the domain, like we did in the sandwich and vending machine examples earlier.</p>
<p>When a function is defined by an equation, the domain is every real number that produces a real number output.</p>
<p>For instance, if $f(x)=\sqrt{x} $ then the domain is any real number greater than or equal to zero, since square roots of negative values are not real numbers.  This can be written as an interval $[0,\infty)$ or with set-builder notation $\lbrace x \vert  x \ge 0 \rbrace $.</p>
<p>Similarly, the domain of $g(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ is every real number except zero, since division by zero is undefined.  Writing this as an interval is a bit tricky since we have to use a union:  $(-\infty,0)  \bigcup  (0,\infty)$.  With set-builder notation we simply say which $x$ values cannot be used: $ \lbrace x \vert  x \neq 0 \rbrace $.</p>
<p>As this example shows, it is often easiest to say what is not in the domain.  Specifically, we must always eliminate from the domain any numbers that result in division by zero and even roots of negative numbers.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

Using interval notation the domain is $(-\infty,-3) \bigcup (-3, 3) \bigcup (3,\infty)$.  With set-builder notation we can write that a bit more compactly as { $ x  \vert  x\neq \pm 3 $ }.</details></p>

<p>Until we gain familiarity with several different types of functions, it will be difficult to determine the range of a function by inspecting its equation.  We will have more success if we work with its graph instead.</p>
<p>Graphs are also one of the best ways to determine the domain of a function.  In fact, we can learn a lot about a function from looking at its graph.  This will be the focus of the next section.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>If you've ever ridden a roller coaster you know how it feels to crawl up a hill and rocket down the other side. You also know how your stomach floats at the top and sinks at the bottom. It would be a very boring ride if the track never changed direction. The twists and turns, peaks and valleys make a roller coaster exciting and give it character.</p>
<p>The same can be said for functions: they wouldn't be interesting (or very useful) if they didn't change.</p>
<p>In this section you will learn to recognize features of a function by looking at a graph, in much the same way that you could pick out the loops and dips of a roller coaster from a photograph.</p>
<h2 id="graphing-functions-with-technology">Graphing Functions with Technology</h2>
<p>When we first encounter a new function we will generally want to see its graph.  The equation will also be an essential tool, but lots of information can be gleaned from a quick look at the graph.</p>
<p>In the previous section we showed how the equation of a function can be used to create a table of values that can be plotted to create a graph.  While knowing how to do that by hand is a useful skill, the technology available today makes exploring graphs of functions much simpler.</p>
<p>Between a graphing calculator, apps on your phone, and dedicated websites like <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos.com</a> or <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic">Geogebra.org</a>, we will assume that you able to use technology to draw a graph of a function.</p>
<p>This section will help you read the graph of function and identify the features you see.</p>
<h2 id="increasing-decreasing-and-constant">Increasing, Decreasing and Constant</h2>
<p>When we read the shape of a function's graph, we always read from left to right, just like we read words in a sentence. For instance, a function <strong>increases</strong> if its graph goes up as we move from left to right and <strong>decreases</strong> if it goes down. These behaviors are also referred to as growth and decay, respectively. If the graph is flat then the function is <strong>constant</strong> on that interval; it does not grow or decay.</p>
<p>Consider the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/increasing_decreasing.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This function is increasing on the interval $(a,b)$, constant on $(b,c)$, decreasing over the interval $(c,d)$ and increasing again on $(d,e)$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Determine the regions where the graph below is increasing, decreasing or constant.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/increasing_decreasing_c.svg#center" alt=""> <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The graph is constant on $A$, increasing on $B$, and decreasing on $C$.</details></p>
</div>
<h2 id="maximums-and-minimums">Maximums and Minimums</h2>
<p>Any point where a function changes from increasing to decreasing is known as a <strong>local maximum</strong>.  On a graph it looks something like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/local_max.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>If $f$ has a local maximum at $x=a$, then $f(a)$ is greater than any other function value in its immediate neighborhood, to the left or right.</p>
<p>If it turns out that $f(a)$ is the largest value of the function over its entire domain, then $f(a)$ is called a <strong>global maximum</strong></p>
<p>Likewise, the point where a function changes from decreasing to increasing is called a <strong>local minimum</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/local_min.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>If $f$ has a local minimum at $x=b$, then $f(b)$ is less than any other function values in the immediate neighborhood.</p>
<p>If it happens that $f(b)$ is the lowest value over the entire domain of the function, then $f(b)$ is called a <strong>global minimum</strong>.</p>
<p>Maximum and minimum points are important in many real life applications. For instance, we might want to minimize cost, or maximize fuel efficiency, or minimize waste.</p>
<p>The process of finding exact maximum and minimum values is called <em>optimization</em> and is properly studied in calculus. For our needs, however, a visual inspection of the graph will usually be accurate enough. When more precision is needed, the <code>maximum</code> and <code>minimum</code> commands found on most graphing utilities can be used.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Use the graph below to answer the questions that follow.</p>

<h2 id="intercepts">Intercepts</h2>
<p>In addition to maximum and minimum points, we should also look for points where the graph intersects the axes. The point where the graph crosses the y-axis is called the <strong>y-intercept</strong>.  An <strong>x-intercept</strong> is a point where the graph intersects the x-axis.</p>

<p>Both of these concepts should be familiar to you from earlier algebra courses. The only new thing to be aware of is that x-intercepts will sometimes be called <strong>real zeros</strong>.  This is because those x-values are real numbers that make the function equal to zero.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Decide if the following statements are True or False.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="concavity">Concavity</h2>
<p>Another important feature of a graph is its curvature, also known as its concavity. If a graph bends up, as if to form the side of a cup, then we say it is <strong>concave up</strong> on that interval. If the graph bends down, like a frown, then it is <strong>concave down</strong>. If the graph is straight then it does not bend and does not have any concavity.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/concavity_details.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that concavity does not tell us if a graph is increasing or decreasing.  Instead, it gives us information about how quickly, or slowly, that change is happening.</p>
<p>For instance, a function that is both increasing and concave down will see its rate of growth slow down.  But the growth rate of an increasing, concave up function will speed up.  Rates of change will be studied in detail <a href="../1.4#rates-of-change">in the next section</a>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="asymptotes">Asymptotes</h2>
<p>Sometimes a function increases (or decreases) without bound toward infinity as it approaches a particular $x$ value. When this happens we say the function has a <strong>vertical asymptote</strong> at that $x$ value.  In this example there is a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/vertical_asymptote.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Formally, the vertical line $x=c$ is a vertical asymptote of a function if $f(x)$ approaches either positive or negative infinity as $x$ gets near to $c$,.  This is sometimes written $f(x)\rightarrow\pm \infty$ as $x \rightarrow c$.</p>
<p>We will use dotted vertical lines to indicate vertical asymptotes. Very few graphing utilities will draw asymptotes. You will have to infer their locations from the shape of the graph.</p>
<p>It is also possible for a function to eventually level off to the left or to the right.  When this happens we say the function has a <strong>horizontal asymptote</strong>. In the example below, the function has a horizontal asymptote at $y=3$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horizontal_asymptote.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Technically speaking, the horizontal line $y=k$ is a horizontal asymptote of a function  if $f(x)\rightarrow k$ as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$.</p>
<p>Horizontal asymptotes describe a type of end behavior of a function.  The <strong>end behavior</strong> of a function is how the function changes as $x$ approaches positive infinity or negative infinity. When looking for end behaviors, it doesn't matter how the function behaves in any local neighborhood, it only matters what happens far out at the ends. We will see functions with various combinations of increasing, decreasing and leveling off end behaviors.</p>
<p>Since a function can only have two end behaviors (one as $x \rightarrow \infty$ and another as $x \rightarrow -\infty$), a function can only have, at most, two horizontal asymptotes. There is no such limit on the number of vertical asymptotes.</p>

<h2 id="complete-graphs">Complete Graphs</h2>
<p>A graph that indicates all the important features of a function is called a <strong>complete graph</strong>.  If a function has any intercepts, asymptotes, maximums and/or minimums, then those should be visible on a complete graph.</p>
<p>Creating a complete graph can be a difficult adventure. Very few, if any, graphing programs will automatically give you a complete graph.  However, they all have commands for zooming in and out and changing the viewing window.</p>
<p>As you learn more about different types of functions, you will be able to reduce the amount of guess work by recognizing how elements of the equation affect the shape of the graph.  For now, however, you will want to experiment with the different zoom and window commands available.</p>
<h2 id="determine-domain-and-range-from-a-graph">Determine Domain and Range from a Graph</h2>
<p>A complete graph can help us identify the domain and range of a function.  Since each point on the graph has an $x$ and a $y=f(x)$ coordinate, the domain and range are the spread of the $x$ and $y$ values, respectively.</p>
<p>For instance, a complete graph of $f(x)=x^{2}-3$ is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/graph_domain_range_x2-3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since the graph continues to expand in the x-direction, its <strong><font color="red">domain</font></strong> is the set of all real numbers $\color{red}{ \lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace  x \text{ is in } \mathbb{R} \rbrace }$ or the interval $\color{red}{(\infty, \infty)}$ or as ausing set-builder notation .  The $\color{blue}{y}$ values start at $\color{blue}{y=-3}$ and continue upward, so the <strong><font color="blue">range</font></strong> is the set $\color{blue}{\lbrace y \thinspace \vert \thinspace y \geq -3 \rbrace}$ or the interval $\color{blue}{[-3, \infty)}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Determine the domain and range of the function shown below.  Assume the graph is a complete graph.

The range is $(-\infty, 5]$, also written as $\lbrace y \thinspace \vert \thinspace y \leq 5 \rbrace$.</details></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Let's look at another example. Suppose the following is a complete graph of a function.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/graph_domain_range_a.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>You might recall that solid dots are always considered part of the graph.  Hollow dots, on the other hand, are used to indicate points that are not part of the graph. Here the <strong><font color="red">domain</font></strong> is the interval $\color{red}{(-2,  2 ]}$ and the <strong><font color="blue">range</font></strong> is $\color{blue}{(-2, 4 ]}$.
<label for="sn-domain_range_1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-domain_range_1" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">In set notation the <strong><font color="red">domain</font></strong> is $\color{red}{ \lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace -2 &lt; x \leq 2 \rbrace }$ and the <strong><font color="blue">range</font></strong> is $\color{blue}{\lbrace y \thinspace \vert \thinspace -2 &lt; y \leq 4 \rbrace}$ </span></p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Determine the domain and range of the function shown below.  Assume the graph is a complete graph.
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/graph_domain_range_d.svg#center" alt=""> <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The domain is $(-3, 2]$, or $\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace -3 &lt; x \leq 2 \rbrace$. <br><br>
The range is $[-3, 5]$, or $\lbrace y \thinspace \vert \thinspace -3 \leq y \leq 5 \rbrace$.</details></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If the graph has asymptotes then the domain and range might require the union of several intervals.  In this case, the vertical asymptotes indicate that the values $x=-1$ and $x=1$ are not in the domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/graph_domain_range_f.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The <strong><font color="red">domain</font></strong> is split into three intervals that we union together:  $\color{red}{(-\infty, -1) \bigcup (-1, 1) \bigcup (1, \infty)}$.  The horizontal asymptote  doesn't impact the range, since the center section rises above the asymptote, so our <strong><font color="blue">range</font></strong> is $\color{blue}{(-\infty, 4]}$.</p>

<h3 id="the-square-function">The Square Function</h3>
<p>The square function $f(x)=x^2$ returns the square of every input, for example $f(3)=3^2=9$.  Its graph is a parabola touching the origin.</p>
<p>With negative inputs it is best to include parenthesis like this $f(-2)=(-2)^2=4$ to get the correct values.<br>

<h3 id="the-square-root-function">The Square Root Function</h3>
<p>The principal square root function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ evaluates the square root of non-negative inputs only, it is not defined for negative values.</p>
<p>Most calculators have a dedicated button for computing square roots.  Its graph starts at the origin.

<h3 id="the-cube-function">The Cube Function</h3>
<p>The cube function $f(x)=x^3$ produces the cube of any input, which is simply that number multiplied by itself three times.  For instance, $f(2)=2^3=8$ since $2 \times 2 \times 2=8$.</p>
<p>Most calculator do not have a dedicated button for the cube function, instead you must enter something like <strong><code>2^3</code></strong> to cube $2$.

<h3 id="the-cube-root-function">The Cube Root Function</h3>
<p>Many calculators have a command somewhere that will evaluate the cube root function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ but it might be hard to find.</p>

<h3 id="the-reciprocal-function">The Reciprocal Function</h3>
<p>The reciprocal function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ takes any number (except $0$) as an input and returns the reciprocal of that number. The easiest way to remember what a reciprocal is, is to see a few examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reciprocal of $\frac{3}{2}$ is $\frac{2}{3}$.</li>
<li>The reciprocal of $5$ is $\frac{1}{5}$.</li>
<li>The reciprocal of $\frac{-6}{7}$ is $\frac{-7}{6}$.</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When making ice cream, chefs often start with a basic recipe and then add in different amounts of special ingredients, like macadamia nuts or dark chocolate or berries. Experienced chefs know the effect that each addition will have before they even taste the finished product.</p>
<p>In a very similar way, we can take basic functions and transform them into new functions by mixing in constants.  As you gain experience you will be able to predict the behavior of a transformed function without graphing it.  You will also learn to construct the equation for a function given its graph.</p>
<p>Given a generic function $f$ and any constant number $\color{blue}{c}$, there are four ways to combine them to form a new function.  We could</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>1.</th>
<th>Add $\color{blue}{c}$ to the function value $f(x)$.</th>
<th>$f(x)+\color{blue}{c}$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Add $\color{blue}{c}$ to the input value $x$.</td>
<td>$f(x+\color{blue}{c})$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Multiply $f(x)$ by $\color{blue}{c}$.</td>
<td>$\color{blue}{c} \thinspace  f(x)$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>Multiply $x$ by $\color{blue}{c}$.</td>
<td>$f(\color{blue}{c} \thinspace x)$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We will use interactive figures to explore each of these combinations.  Pay special attention to how both the graph and the equation change as you apply the transformation.  It may even help to keep track of one or two points and compare their locations before and after the transformation.</p>
<h2 id="vertical-shifts">Vertical Shifts</h2>
<p>The first transformation we want to look at is adding a constant $\color{blue}{c}$ to the output of the function, $f(x)$.</p>
<p>In this figure you can change the value of $\color{blue}{c}$. The graph of the original function $\color{black}{f(x)}$ is shown in $\color{black}{black}$.  The transformed function $\color{red}{f(x)}  \color{blue}{+ c}$ will be shown in $\color{red}{red}$.</p>
<p>How would you describe the relationship between the two graphs?</p>

<p>The result of adding a constant to a function is that the graph moves up or down $\color{blue}{c}$ spaces.</p>
<p>More formally, if $\color{red}{f}$ is any function and $\color{blue}{c}$ is any constant, then the graph $\color{red}{f(x)}  \color{blue}{+ c}$ is a <strong>vertical shift</strong> of the function $f$.  The graph of $\color{red}{f(x)}  \color{blue}{+ c}$ can be found by adding $\color{blue}{c}$ to every y-value of the original graph.  We can summarize this by saying</p>
<ul>
<li>If $\color{blue}{c&gt;0}$, then $\color{red}{f(x)} \color{blue}{+ c}$ is found by shifting the graph of $f$ up $\color{blue}{c}$ spaces.</li>

You have just seen that the graph of $\color{red}{f(x } \color{blue}{+ c}\color{red}{)}$ is a <strong>horizontal shift</strong> of the function $f$.  The graph of $\color{red}{f(x } \color{blue}{+ c}\color{red}{)}$  can be found by subtracting $\color{blue}{c}$ from every x-value of the original graph.  In other words,
<ul>
<li>If $\color{blue}{c&gt;0}$, then $\color{red}{f(x} \color{blue}{+ c}\color{red}{)}$ is found by shifting $f$ to the left $\color{blue}{c}$ spaces.</li>
<li>If $\color{blue}{c&lt;0}$, then $\color{red}{f(x } \color{blue}{+ c}\color{red}{)}$ is found by shifting $f$ to the right $\color{blue}{c}$ spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Horizontal shifts are somewhat counter intuitive, and you will want to refer back to this chart often as you work through the exercises.</p>
<p>Vertical and horizontal shifts do not change the shape of the graph, only its location.  Our next few transformations, however, will alter the shape of the graph.</p>

<p>The two previous transformations involved addition and resulted in a shift.  Using the figure below, you can discover the effect of multiplying a function by a positive constant $\color{blue}{c}$.  As you change the value of $\color{blue}{c}$ , the graph of  $\color{blue}{c}\color{red}{ f(x)}$ will change as well.  How would you describe this change?</p>

<p>Hopefully you noticed that multiplying a function by a constant $\color{blue}{c}$ stretches the graph up and down.</p>
<p>In other words, if $\color{red}{f}$ is any function and $\color{blue}{c}$ is any constant, then the graph of  $\color{blue}{c}\color{red}{ f(x)}$ is a <strong>vertical stretch</strong> of the original function $\color{red}{f}$. The graph of $\color{blue}{c}\color{red}{ f(x)}$ can be found by multiplying each y-value of the original graph by $\color{blue}{c}$.</p>
<p>If $\color{blue}{0&lt;c&lt;1}$, then the graph $\color{blue}{c}\color{red}{f(x)}$ is sometimes called a vertical <em>compression</em> of the graph of $\color{red}{f}$.  We will use the word stretch for both situations, with the understanding that the graph is always scaled by a factor of $\color{blue}{c}$.</p>

This <strong>horizontal stretch</strong> is one of the most counter-intuitive transformations you will encounter.  You should have seen that the graph got wider when $\color{blue}{c}$ was small, and narrower when $\color{blue}{c}$ was large.
<p>When we encounter a transformation of the form $\color{red}{f (} \color{blue}{c}\thinspace \color{red}{x)}$,  its graph can be found by dividing each x-value of the original graph by $\color{blue}{c}$.</p>
<ul>
<li>If $\color{blue}{c&gt;1}$, then the resulting graph is <em>compressed</em> horizontally.</li>
<li>If $\color{blue}{0&lt;c&lt;1}$, then the resulting graph is <em>stretched</em> horizontally.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, the x-values are always scaled by a factor of $\color{blue}{1/c}$.</p>

<p>Notice that the location of the constant indicates whether the transformation is vertical or horizontal.  Changes <em>outside</em> the function alter the y-coordinate and result in vertical transformations, while changes <em>inside</em> the function impact the x-coordinate and cause horizontal transformations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can determine if the transformation is a shift or a stretch by looking at the operation. Shifts are addition, stretches are multiplication.  Horizontal transformations always behave in a counter intuitive way, so you will want to be extra careful with them.</p>

<h2 id="even-and-odd-symmetry">Even and Odd Symmetry</h2>
<p>When reflecting a graph, two interesting things happen sometimes.  The first is that a horizontal reflection across the y-axis might  produce the same exact graph as the original function.  Symbolically, $f(-x)=f(x)$.  When this happens we say that the function has <strong>even symmetry</strong>, or is symmetric across the y-axis.   The figure below illustrates the concept.</p>

<p>The other interesting thing that can happen with reflections is that a horizontal reflection and a vertical reflection might have the same result, that is $f(-x)=-f(x)$.  When this happens the function has <strong>odd symmetry</strong> and is symmetric around the origin.  Visually, a 180-degree rotation around the origin produces the same exact image.  This is illustrated in the following interactive figure.</p>

<h2 id="verifying-symmetry-algebraically">Verifying Symmetry Algebraically</h2>
<p>While visual identification of symmetry is quick and easy, our eyes can sometimes be deceived.  If a function is defined by an equation, then it is best to verify symmetry algebraically.  If a function is even, then we should be able to demonstrate that the equations for $f(-x)$ and $f(x)$ are the same.  If has odd symmetry, then the equations for $f(-x)$ and $-f(x)$ should be identical.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/symmetry_check_algebraic.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Consider the graph of $f(x)=x^3+0.01$, which appears to have odd symmetry.  Checking the equations we find that</p>
<p>[
f(-x) = (-x)^3+0.01 = -x^3+0.01
]</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>[
-f(x) = -(x^3+0.01) = -x^3-0.01
]</p>
<p>Since the two equations are not the same,  $f(x)=x^3+0.01$ does not have odd symmetry.</p>
<p>A second look at the equation explains why this is the case.  Notice that $f(x)=x^3+0.01$ is nothing more than the cube function shifted $0.01$ units up.  It's graph</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/symmetry_check_algebraic_graph.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>does not go through the origin, rather it has a y-intercept at $(0, 0.01)$.  It is this small shift that causes the function to loose its odd symmetry.</p>
<p>Let's look at one more example.  The graph of $f(x)=x^{2}-1$ looks like it has even symmetry.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/symmetry_check_algebraic_graph_2.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>To check this algebraically, we need to compare the equation for $f(-x)$ with the equation for $f(x)$.  If the two match, then it really does have even symmetry.  Otherwise, it does not.</p>
<p>Replacing $x$ with $-x$ we find that</p>
<p>[
f(-x) = (-x)^2-1 = x^{2}-1
]</p>
<p>which is exactly the same equation as $f(x)$.  Since $f(-x)=f(x)$, we can confidently conclude that $f(x)=x^{2}-1$ has even symmetry.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In future chapters, we will find transformations included in the standard forms of several function models.  Being able to predict the effects of a shift or stretch will often simplify calculations and may give insight into easier techniques for solving equations.</p>
<p>Transformations will be helpful when we model data in Chapter 6.  If a data set looks like a line, for example, then we can apply shifts and stretches to the identity function $f(x)=x$ until we find a combination that fits the shape of the data.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Imagine that you flew to Tahiti for a vacation.  After spending some time enjoying the white sandy beaches and crystal clear water, you <em>might</em> want to return home.  To get back home you would need to find a return flight.</p>
<p>In mathematics, a process that brings you back to where you started is called an <strong>inverse</strong>.</p>
<p>In this section you will learn to recognize when a function has an inverse and how to find it.</p>
<h2 id="inverse-operations">Inverse Operations</h2>
<p>Many real life processes have inverses while others do not.  For instance, if you put on your shoes and socks you can easily take them off, but once you boil an egg there's no way to make it raw again.</p>
<p>You are, no doubt, already familiar with some <strong>inverse operations</strong> in mathematics.  Adding and subtracting are inverse operations, for instance.  If you add $6$, and then subtract $6$, you end up right back where you started, having completed a round trip.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_add_6.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Multiplication and division are also inverse operations.  As an example, multiplying by $-3$ and dividing by $-3$ are inverse operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_multiply_neg_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The only exception is $0$.  Multiplying by $0$ cannot be undone with division, since division by $0$ is not well defined.</p>
<p>There are other operations that sometimes have inverses and sometimes do not.  Powers and roots are prime examples. When working with positive numbers, powers and roots are always inverses.  Here are a few powers of $2$ and the corresponding roots, for instance.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_square_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_cube_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_4th_power_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>It gets more complicated when working with negative numbers, however.  Consider the following powers and roots of $ -5$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_square_neg_5.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_cube_neg_5.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_4th_power_neg_5.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This time, taking an even power followed by an even root did not produce a round trip.  This indicates that even powers and roots are not always inverse operations.  Even powers and roots are inverses only when working with non-negative numbers.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the basic inverse operations.</p>

<h2 id="definition-of-an-inverse-function">Definition of an Inverse Function</h2>
<p>If a function has an inverse, then the inverse function should return each output back to its input, just like a return airline flight.  <div class="alert alert-info"></p>
  <h4>DEFINITION</h4>
   The <strong>inverse</strong> of a function $f$ is a function $f^{-1}$ with the property that whenever $f(a)=b$, it always follows that $f^{-1}(b)=a$.
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_function_diagram.svg#center" alt=""></p>
</div>
<p>Note that the outputs of the original function become the inputs of the inverse function.  As a consequence, the domain of $f$ is the range of $f^{-1}$, and the range of $f$ is the domain of $f^{-1}$.</p>
<p>This new notation can be a bit confusing.  The symbol $f^{-1}$ is used to indicate the &quot;inverse of $f $ &quot;.  Even though the $-1$ looks like an exponent it is not:  $f^{-1}$ does <strong>not</strong> mean $\frac{1}{f}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>
<p>Suppose the function $f$ has an inverse and that $f(3)=6$. What do you know about $f^{-1}(6)$?  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />$f^{-1}(6)=3$</details></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose the domain of $f$ is $D= \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4 \rbrace$ and that its range is $R= \lbrace 5, 6, 7, 8 \rbrace$.  What are the domain and range of $f^{-1}$?  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The domain and range trade places.  The domain of the inverse function is the set $D = \lbrace 5, 6, 7, 8 \rbrace$ and its range is $R = \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4 \rbrace$.</details></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="identify-invertible-functions">Identify Invertible Functions</h2>
<p>Let's look at two functions defined by diagrams and see if they have inverse functions.</p>
<p>This first function matches Josie, Ahani, and Mary with their favorite fruit.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_e.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that it is easy to match each fruit back to the person who likes it by reversing the diagram for $f$.  This means that $f$ has an inverse function.</p>
<p>The situation is different with the second function which pairs the same people with their Italian dream car.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_f.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since both Josie and Ahani prefer Ferrari, we are unable to map Ferrari back to a single person.  Thus, according to our definition, $g$ does not have an inverse.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate the general situation.  Functions only have inverses if each output comes from just one input.  In other words, different inputs always generate different outputs.  The only way for $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ is for $x_1 = x_2$.  Functions with this property are called <strong>one-to-one</strong> functions.  Only one-to-one functions have inverses.</p>
<p>When a function is defined by a diagram, you can determine if it is one-to-one by inspecting each input-output pair.  If two or more different inputs are paired with the same output, then the function is not one-to-one and does not have an inverse.  This technique can also be used when the function is defined by a table or a list of points.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

<h2 id="the-horizontal-line-test">The Horizontal Line Test</h2>
<p>Since different inputs to a one-to-one function always create different outputs, no two points on the graph of a one-to-one function can have the same y-coordinate.</p>
<p>A quick way to test this is to draw (or imagine drawing) several horizontal lines through the graph.  If the function is one-to-one, then no horizontal line will cross the graph more than once.  This test is called the <strong>horizontal line test</strong> and works exactly like the vertical line test, except in the horizontal direction.

<p>Consider again the function that matched Jill, Alicia and Mary with their favorite fruit.  Since it is a one-to-one function, it must have an inverse function.  We can construct the inverse function $f^{-1}$ by reversing the diagram for $f$.</p>

<h2 id="graph-the-inverse-of-a-function">Graph the Inverse of a Function</h2>
<p>This idea of reversing the ordered pairs to find the inverse can be used to graph inverse functions, even if we don't know their equations.  We can do this by identifying a point $(\color{red}{x}, \color{blue}{y})$ on the graph of $f$ and reversing the coordinates.  The new point $(\color{blue}{y}, \color{red}{x})$ will be on the graph of $f^{-1}$.</p>
<p>Use the interactive figure below to explore this relationship.  As you move the blue point $\color{blue}{(x, y)}$ on $f$ the inverse point $\color{black}{(y, x)}$ on $f^{-1}$ will be plotted.</p>

<p>As you might have noticed, reversing the ordered pairs has the same effect as reflecting the graph across the line $y=x$.  In fact, a quick way to graph an inverse by hand is to locate a few points on the graph of $f$ and reflect them.</p>
<h2 id="inverses-of-basic-functions">Inverses of Basic Functions</h2>
<p>When a function is defined by a single operation, finding the inverse is as simple as finding the inverse operation, if it exists.  This is the case with several of our six basic functions.</p>
<h3 id="cube--cube-root">Cube &amp; Cube Root</h3>
<p>For instance, since the cube and cube root are opposite operations, the cube and cube root functions are inverses of each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_cube.svg#center" alt=""> <img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_cube_root.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that both functions pass the horizontal line test.</p>
<h3 id="square--square-root">Square &amp; Square Root</h3>
<p>The square function, on the other hand, does not pass the horizontal line test, so it cannot have an inverse.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_square.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>At the same time, it certainly would be useful to think of the square and square root functions as inverses.  Perhaps there is a way to work around this?</p>
<p>The solution is to remember that the square and square root are inverse operations only when working with non-negative numbers.  If we restrict the domain and only work with $f(x)=x^{2}$ when $x \geq 0$, then we will have a pair of inverse functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_square_restricted.svg#center" alt=""> <img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_square_root.svg#center" alt=""></p>

</div>
<h2 id="use-the-shoes-and-socks-method-to-find-inverses">Use the Shoes and Socks Method to Find Inverses</h2>
<p>You have learned that if a one-to-one function is defined by a diagram, table, or graph, then its inverse can be found by reversing the ordered pairs.  If the function is defined by a single operation, then the inverse is the function that performs the opposite operation.</p>
<p>When functions include several operations there are two methods for finding the inverse, if it exists.  In <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/chapter-4/4.4#learn-the-switch-and-solve-method">Chapter 4</a> you will learn a <strong>switch and solve</strong> method based on the idea of reversing the ordered pairs of a function.</p>
<p>Right now, however, the focus is on a simpler <strong>socks and shoes</strong> method.  This method gets its name from the obvious place.  When getting dressed you put on your socks before putting on your shoes.  To take them off you must reverse the order:  first remove your shoes and then take off your socks.</p>
<p>A great illustration of this method comes from the classic television program <em>Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood</em>.
<label for="mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="marginnote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/Mr-Rogers-stamp.jpg" alt=""> The U.S. Postal Service honored Fred Rogers (1928–2003) with a Forever stamp on the 50th anniversary of <em>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</em> in March, 2018.</span>
At the start of each episode, the late Fred Rogers would walk in singing the song &quot;Won't You Be My Neighbor?&quot;  As he sang he would</p>
<ol>
<li>Take off his jacket</li>
<li>Put on a sweater</li>
<li>Take off his shoes</li>
<li>Put on sneakers</li>

<ol>
<li>Take off the sneakers</li>
<li>Put on his shoes</li>
<li>Take off the sweater</li>
<li>Put on his jacket</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the two lists contain the inverse actions <em>in the reverse order</em>.  That is the key!  If we can identify the order in which a function performs its operations, we should be able to construct its inverse by doing the inverse operations in the reverse order.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the function $f(x)=3x-2$.  Following the standard order of operations, this function first multiplies each input by $3$ and then subtracts $2$.</p>
<p>The inverse function must do the inverse operations in the reverse order: add $2$ and then divide by $3$.</p>
<p>Now that we have identified the operations that the inverse should do, we construct the equation for $f^{-1}$ by applying each of those operations, in the order listed, to a variable.  The steps are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>1.</th>
<th>Start with a variable</th>
<th>$x$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Add $2$</td>
<td>[x+2]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Divide by $3$</td>
<td>[\frac{x+2}{3}]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>Write as a function</td>
<td>[f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x+2}{3}]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We should also check that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ have the round trip property we have seen earlier.  To do this pick any random number, see where $f$ takes that number, and then check to see if $f^{-1}$ will bring it back.  For instance, if $x=7$ then $f(\color{red}{7})=\color{blue}{19}$ and $f^{-1}(\color{blue}{19})=\color{red}{7}$</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_equation_a.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>so the round trip property appears to hold.  It would be good to test this with a few more random values just to make sure.  In <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/chapter-4/4.4#verify-inverse-functions">Chapter 4</a> we will discuss a way to formally verify that it works for any number.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Find the inverse of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+1}{4}$. <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The function adds $1$ and then divides by $4$, so the inverse must first multiply by $4$ and then subtract $1$.  The equation would be $f^{-1}(x)=4x-1$.</details></div>
<p>Now let's use the shoes-and-socks method to find the inverse of $f(x) = 2x^3 + 4$.  We begin by identifying the operations performed by the function, and then invert the list to find the operations of the inverse function.</p>

<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Add $4$</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now that we know what the inverse function does, we construct its equation as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Start with a variable:</th>
<th>$x$</th>

<tr>
<td>Subtract $4$:</td>
<td>[x-4]</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Write as a function:</td>
<td>$$f^{-1}(x)=\sqrt[3]{\frac{x-4}{2}}$$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It's also a good idea to check the round trip property with at least one value, let's see what happens when $x=2$.</p>

<p>But when we check the round trip property we see that some values, such as $x=-5$, don't work.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_equation_c.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This is because we have made a critical oversight.  A <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/graph_(x+1)2.png">graph</a> of $f(x) = (x+1)^2$ shows that it is <em>not</em> a one-to-one function, so it cannot have an inverse unless we <strong>restrict the domain</strong>.  To do this we require the input of the square to be greater than or equal to zero.  In this case, we need $x+1 \geq 0$, which is the same thing as saying $x \geq -1$.  Only when we restrict domain of $f(x)=(x+1)^2$ to $x \geq -1$ will the two functions will be inverses.  We will have to keep an eye out for this any time a function, or its potential inverse, includes an even power.</p>
<h2 id="interpreting-inverse-functions">Interpreting Inverse Functions</h2>
<p>Earlier in this section we found that the domain and range of $f$ become the range and domain, respectively, of the inverse function $f^{-1}$.  Not only do the domain and range trade places, but their units of measure do as well.  Keeping track of those units makes it much easier to understand the significance of an inverse function.</p>
<p>For instance, the amount of time $T$ that it takes you to drive to work in minutes is a function of how fast you drive in miles per hour.  In theory, if you know your average speed $S$, then you can predict how long the trip will take.</p>
<p>The inverse function, if it exists, would turn speed into a function that depends on the time.  With the inverse function, knowing the duration of the trip allows you to calculate the average speed. Symbolically, if $T=f(S)$, then $S=f^{-1}(T)$.</p>
<p>With this understanding, the distinction between $f(45)$ and $f^{-1}(45)$ is much more clear.  In this example, $f(45)$ would be the time it takes to drive to work if the average speed is $45$ mph.  On the other hand, $f^{-1}(45)$ would be the speed required so that the trip takes $45$ minutes.</p>

<p>In this section we have seen how to identify when a function has an inverse and discussed techniques for finding and interpreting the inverse.  We have also hinted at the fact that an equation only has a unique solution if the underlying function is one-to-one.</p>
<p>In the following chapters, every time we learn about a new function we will also check to see if it is one-to-one or not.  If it is, then we will also look for its inverse.  If not, then we will consider restricting its domain and focusing on a smaller piece of the function that does have an inverse.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When the stock market opened on Monday, October 22, 2001, stock in Enron (a large Fortune-500 energy company) was trading for about $20 per share.</p>
<p>At the same time stock in Apple (the electronics manufacturer) could be also be purchased for $20.</p>
<p>Without additional information, it would be natural to assume that state of both companies was the same.  In reality, however, they were headed in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Later that day, the SEC announced they were investigating Enron for accounting irregularities.  Within weeks the company declared bankruptcy and several Enron executives were sent to prison for fraud and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, had an important announcement of their own.  The next day, on October 23, 2001, Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the very first iPod.  It was an iconic success that revolutionized the consumer electronics industry and helped establish Apple as one of the most innovative technology companies in the world.</p>
<p>As we've seen earlier, functions, just like stocks, can increase and decrease in value. Our goal in this section is to develop tools that allow us to measure, compare and categorize functions based on how they change.</p>
<h2 id="intervals">Intervals</h2>
<p>In <a href="../1.3">section 1.3</a> we saw how to visually identify regions where a function is increasing, decreasing or constant.  We also saw portions of graphs that were concave up or concave down.</p>
<p>Since functions can behave differently on different subsets of their domain, we will need to describe the specific <a href="../1.1#intervals-of-real-numbers">intervals</a> we are inspecting.</p>
<p>For instance, on this graph</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/increasing_decreasing.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>the function is increasing on the interval $(a,b)$, constant on $(b,c)$, decreasing over the interval $(c,d)$ and increasing again on $(d,e)$.
<label for="sn-intervals" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-intervals" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">Generally a function is not increasing, decreasing or constant at the endpoints of an interval so we usually write those intervals with parenthesis $( \thinspace\thinspace)$, and not brackets $[ \thinspace\thinspace ]$ unless circumstances dictate otherwise.</span></p>
<p>Take special note that these intervals are only on the x-axis.  That is because they are parts of the domain of the function.  We will use y-values in a moment to measure how much the function has increased or decreased.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying a specific interval, we might also need to measure how long it is.  The length of an interval from $a$ to $b$ is given by</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>[\Delta x = b-a]</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>The upper-case Greek leter delta ($\Delta$) is used throughout math and science to indicate change.  If we mention the &quot;change in the x-values&quot; then that is the same as $\Delta x$ which is also the same thing as the length of the interval $[a, b]$.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="total-change">Total Change</h2>
<p>The amount that a function has increased or decreased on an interval is called the <strong>total change</strong> of the function.   The symbol $\Delta y$ means the change in the y-values and will be used to represent total change.</p>
<p>To calculate the total change of a function on some interval $[a, b]$ we find the difference between the starting value $f(a)$ and the ending value $f(b)$.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>[\Delta y = f(b)-f(a)]</th>

</thead>
</table>
<p>Notice that the total change does not care about what happens in the middle of the interval, it only uses the values of the function at the ends of the interval.</p>
<p>Both $\Delta y$ and $\Delta x$ are illustrated in the diagram below.</p>

<h2 id="percent-change">Percent Change</h2>
<p>If you won a million dollars you might feel like that's a really big change.  But if someone told you the government was going to increase national spending on education by a million dollars you'd probably feel like that is a very  small change, even though the amount is exactly the same.  That is one of the limitations of total change; it doesn't relate the change to the starting value.  To do that we need a <em>percent</em> change formula.</p>
<p>The <strong>percent change</strong> of a function $f$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is the ratio of the total change to the starting value.  We calculate percent change as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>[\text{percent change} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{f(a)}]</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>With this formula the percent change is given in decimal form.  In other words, a value such as $0.12$ should be interpreted as $12\%$.  Also note that the percent change cannot be computed if $f(a)=0$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="average-rate-of-change">Average Rate of Change</h2>
<p>While percent change helps you see the relative increase or decrease in values, it does not indicate how quickly the change is happening.  To see how rapidly function values change we need to average the total change across the length of the interval.</p>
<p>You are probably already familiar with the basic process of finding averages.  For instance, if you drove a distance of 100 miles in 2 hours then your average speed would be $\frac{100 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}$.</p>
<p>Your actual speed may have gone up and down during the trip but, on average, your speed was 50 miles per hour.</p>
<p>To find the average change of a function we follow the same process and divide the total change of the function $\Delta y$ by the corresponding change $\Delta x$ in the input values to get $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>[ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}  = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}]</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>Since $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is a ratio, it is often called the <strong>average <em>rate</em> of change</strong> of a function.  The resulting quantities describe per unit changes.  That is to say, by averaging we can tell what will happen to $f(x)$ every time $x$ increases by $1$.</p>
<p>To see how this works let's find the average rate of change of $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ on the interval $[9, 100]$.  Using the formula above we see that</p>
<p>[ \begin{align}
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{100} - \sqrt{9}} {100 - 9} \newline
&amp;= \frac{10-3}{91} \newline
&amp;= \frac{7}{91} \newline
&amp;\approx 0.077
\end{align}]</p>
<p>This means that from $x=9$ to $x=100$ the function $f(x)=\sqrt x$ increases, on average, by $0.077$ units every time $x$ increases by $1$ unit.</p>
<p>It's important to point out that unless the function is linear, the average rate of change of a function will be different over different intervals.  The value we get depends on the specific interval $[a, b]$ chosen.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Calculate the average rate of change of $f(x)=\sqrt x$ over the interval $[0,16]$.  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />[\begin{align}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{0}}{16-0} \newline &amp;= \frac{4-0}{16} \newline &amp;= \frac{1}{4} \end{align}]</details></div>
<p>The average rate of change formula might look familiar.  That's because it is the same thing as the <em>slope</em> of the line connecting the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.  This line is called a secant line.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/secant.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>When a function is defined by a graph, the average rate of change can always be found by calculating the slope of the secant line.</p>

<h2 id="concavity-and-rates-that-change">Concavity and Rates that Change</h2>
<p>We've seen before that functions can curve up or curve down allowing the function to change a different speeds.  In other words, <a href="../1.3#concavity">concavity</a> is an indication that the rates of change themselves can change.</p>
<p>For instance, an increasing function could grow at a steady rate, at a rate that quickens, or at a rate that slows.  All three options are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/increasing_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Functions can also decrease at constant, increasing, and decreasing rates.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/decreasing_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>While working with these changes in the rate is a topic best studied in calculus, it's not too difficult to recognize situations where rates change.</p>

<h2 id="difference-quotients">Difference Quotients</h2>
<p>The formulas we have used so far show what happens on a specific interval.  We'll now build a mechanism that has the potential to describe the behavior of a function on every interval all at once.</p>
<p>The tool that does this is called the <strong>difference quotient</strong>.  The difference quotient $D(x)$ is a function that lets us calculate the average rate of change on a generic interval from $x$ to  $x+h$, where  $h$  is any positive number.  This is the same thing as the average rate of change, but with a change in notation.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>To see how the difference quotient is derived from the average rate of change formula, we substitute $\color{red}{x}$ in place of  $\color{red}{a}$, and $\color{blue}{x+h}$  in place of  $\color{blue}{b}$ and simplify.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
\frac{f(\color{blue}{b})-f(\color{red}{a})}{\color{blue}{b}-\color{red}{a}} &amp;= \frac{f(\color{blue}{x+h})-f(\color{red}{x})}{\color{blue}{(x+h)}-\color{red}{x}} \newline \newline
&amp;= \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>The behavior of $D(x)$ is connected to how the function $f(x)$ changes in two important ways.  First, whether the function is strictly increasing, decreasing or constant on an interval impacts the sign of $D(x)$.</p>
<ul>
<li>If $f(x)$ is increasing on an interval, then the difference quotient is positive on that same interval.</li>
<li>If $f(x)$ is decreasing on an interval, then the difference quotient will be negative on that interval.</li>
<li>If $f(x)$ is constant over an interval, then the difference quotient is $0$ over that interval.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, the concavity of the function tells us if $D(x)$ itself is increasing, decreasing or constant.  That is to say,</p>
<ul>
<li>If $f(x)$ is concave up on an interval, then $D(x)$ increases over that interval.</li>
<li>If $f(x)$ is concave down on an interval, then $D(x)$ decreases on that interval.</li>
<li>On any interval where $f(x)$ is a straight line, $D(x)$ will be constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's examine a few simple examples.  The function $f(x)=3x+2$ is an increasing linear function, so we expect the difference quotient to be a positive constant value, and it is.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient_3x+2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the value of the difference quotient is exactly the same as the value of the slope of the line.</p>
<p>For our final example, we'll look at the square function $f(x)=x^{2}$.  We know that this function is concave up over its entire domain of all real numbers, so we expcect its difference quotient will always be increasing.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient_x_squared.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that no matter what value $h$ happens to be, $D(x)$ is always increasing since it is a linear function with a slope of $2$.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Exploring how functions change is a fascinating topic and is foundational to calculus.  Not only will calculus teach you more about efficiently computing <em>average</em> rates of change, you will also learn to use the difference quotient to calculate <em>instantaneous</em> rates change, leading to the concept of a <strong>derivative</strong>.</p>
<p>But for now, it is enough to know that functions with similar behaviors have similar difference quotients, allowing us to group them together into different families that we will encounter in the next chapters.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Part of the enjoyment of art comes from its patterns of sound and color and motion.</p>
<p>Patterns are also an essential part of mathematics.  The British mathematician G. H. Hardy once said that <em>&quot;A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.   If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>In this section, we will find an underlying structure that unifies the <a href="../../chapter-1/1.3#graphs-of-basic-functions">six basic functions from Chapter 1</a> and opens up a new category of functions for our use.</p>
<h2 id="power-functions">Power Functions</h2>
<p>When working with a group of functions, the first pattern we look for is any similarity in the <em>form</em>, or equation, of the functions.  Once we have identified a pattern, we can create new functions by changing the parameters of that basic equation.</p>
<p>For instance, these three functions</p>
<p>\begin{align}
\text{identity function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= x = x^1 \newline
\text{square function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= x^{2} \newline
\text{cube function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= x^3 \newline
\end{align}</p>
<p>are all written in the form $f(x)=x^{p}$, where $p$ is the power of the variable $x$.  New functions can be made by taking that basic format and changing the power $p$.  Since the power is the important parameter of the equation, we will call these <em>power</em> functions.</p>
<p>In general, a <strong>power function</strong> is any function that can be written as $f(x)=x^{p}$, where $p$ is a constant.  Notice that the variable must be raised to a fixed power.  That power can be positive or negative, a whole number, a fraction or a decimal, but it cannot be a variable.  As an example, $g(x)=3^{x}$ has a variable exponent, so it cannot be a power function even though it looks somewhat similar.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Decide if the following are power functions or not.  If it is, identify the value of the power $p$.</p>

<h2 id="use-rules-of-exponents-to-identify-power-functions">Use Rules of Exponents to Identify Power Functions</h2>
<p>We now know that the identity, square and cube are all power functions, but what about the other basic functions from Chapter 1?  At first glance, these functions</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align}
\text{reciprocal function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{x} \newline
\text{square root function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= \sqrt{x} \newline
\text{cube root function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= \sqrt[3]{x}
\end{align}
$$</p>
<p>do not appear to be power functions since they are not written in the form $f(x)=x^{p}$.</p>
<p>However, any function that <em>can</em> be written as $f(x)=x^{ p}$ is a power function, even if it is often written in a different format.  A brief review of a few rules of exponents will show that these three functions are indeed power functions.</p>
<h3 id="negative-powers">Negative Powers</h3>
<p>You might recall the rule $\frac{1}{x}=x^{-1}$.  This tells us that the <em>reciprocal function</em> $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$  is the same as the power function $f(x) =  x^{-1}$.  The general rule of exponents at work here is</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{x^{n}}=x^{-n}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>This rule can be used to convert any reciprocal-type function into a power function.  For instance, $f(x)=\frac{1}{x^{5}}$ can be rewritten in the standard power function format as $f(x)=x^{-5}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Rewrite the following functions in the standard power function form.</p>

</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="roots">Roots</h3>
<p>Another rule of exponents allows us to rewrite roots as fractional powers.  Specifically,</p>
<p>$$
\sqrt[m]{x}  =  x^{1/m}
$$</p>
<p>From this we see that the <em>square root</em> function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ and the <em>cube root</em> function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ can be written as power functions where the powers are $1/2$ and $1/3$, respectively.</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
f(x)=\sqrt{{x}}  =  x^{1/2}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}  =  x^{1/3}
$$</p>
<p>Other roots can be rewritten as power functions in the same way.  For instance, $f(x)=\sqrt[8]{x}   =  x^{1/8}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Rewrite the following functions in the standard power function form.</p>

</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="fractional-powers">Fractional Powers</h3>
<p>The family of power functions also includes roots of powers, such as $f(x)=\sqrt[m]{x^{n}}$ , or powers of roots like $f(x)=(\sqrt[m]{x})^{n}$, which happen to be the same thing.  These can be rewritten as power functions where the power is a rational number, or faction, of the form $p=n/m$, such as $-3/8$ or $2/5$.</p>
<p>$$
\sqrt[m]{ x^n }  =  \left(\sqrt[m]{x}\right)^{n}  =  x^{n/m}
$$</p>
<p>Since all three forms are equivalent, you may be asked to convert one into the others.  The power function $f(x)  = x^{2/5 }$, for instance, can also be written as  $f(x) =  \sqrt[5]{x^{2}}$ or as $f(x) =  (\sqrt[5]{x})^2$.</p>

<h2 id="evaluating-power-functions">Evaluating Power functions</h2>
<p>When using a calculator to evaluate and graph power functions we need to be careful to wrap $x$ and/or $p$ in parenthesis anytime either one is anything other than a whole number. For example, if $f(x)=x^{2/5}$ then to evaluate $f(-3/8)$  parenthesis should be put around both $-3/8$ and around the power $2/5$.  Without parenthesis, the normal order of operations would give a very different answer.</p>

<td><code>-3/8^2/5 = -0.009375</code></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>We should also keep in mind that many power functions are not defined when $x&lt;0$, and that if the power is negative then $0$ is not in the domain.  Expressions involving either of these will produce an error message on your calculator.</p>

<h2 id="graphs-of-power-functions">Graphs of Power Functions</h2>
<p>While technology can be used to graph power functions, you can often create a &quot;good enough&quot; sketch within seconds just by examining the equation.  The shape of the graph of a power function $f(x)=x^{ p}$ is controlled by the value of the power $p$.  In this interactive figure you can use the <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> slider to change $p$.</p>
<p>Since many powers are undefined when $x&lt; 0$, we will focus on the first quadrant for now.   As you change $p$, look for patterns or similarities between the different graphs.  In particular, try to group the graphs into <em>three</em> distinct shapes.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, all power functions pass through the point $(1,\ 1)$, though they do so in three different ways depending on the power $p$.  The three behavior patterns are separated from one another by $p=0$ (when we get the horizontal line $y=1$) and $p=1$ (when we get the identity function $y=x$).</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/powers_all_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>In Chapter 1 you learned how to identify several characteristics of a function by reading its graph.  Since understanding the properties of these three shapes will impact your ability to use power functions effectively, our next goal is to analyze each of these shapes individually.</p>
<h3 id="case-1-colorredp0">Case 1: $\color{red}{p&lt;0}$</h3>
<p>Let's start with the case where the power is negative, that is $p&lt;0$.  Notice that this graph resembles the right side of the <a href="//chapter-1/1.3#the-reciprocal-function">reciprocal function</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_a.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at the graph we see that it drops sharply along the y-axis and levels off toward the positive x-axis, as you move from left to right.  In mathematical terms, the graph is both decreasing and concave up on the interval $(0, \infty)$, with a vertical asymptote at $x=0$ (the y-axis) and a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$ (the x-axis).</p>
<p>Because of the asymptotes, the graph never reaches a minimum nor a maximum value.  Based on the shape of the graph, it would be reasonable to use this type of power function to represent quantities that decay as $x$ increases.</p>
<h3 id="case-2-colorgreen0p1">Case 2: $\color{green}{0&lt;p&lt;1}$</h3>
<p>If the power is small, that is $0&lt;p&lt;1$, then the graph of the power function $f(x)=x^{p}$ is increasing and concave down over the interval $(0, \infty)$.   Note that this shape resembles the <a href="//chapter-1/1.3#the-square-root-function">square root function</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_b.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The graph has a minimum value at $(0, 0)$, but does not have a maximum or any asymptotes.  Since the graph is concave down, the rate of increase is decreasing, suggesting that this type of power function might model quantities whose growth is slowing down.</p>
<h3 id="case-3-colorbluep1">Case 3: $\color{blue}{p&gt;1}$</h3>
<p>When $p&gt;1$, the power function $f(x)=x^{p}$ increases and is concave up on the interval $(0, \infty)$.   This graph resembles the right side of the <a href="//chapter-1/1.3#the-square-function">square function</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_c.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>There is a minimum value at the origin $(0, 0)$, but no maximums or asymptotes.  These functions will be useful when modeling quantities that grow faster and faster.  Lastly, note that this graph, along with the two previous ones, is one-to-one and must have an inverse.</p>
<h2 id="symmetry-of-power-functions">Symmetry of Power Functions</h2>
<p>So far, we have restricted our attention to power functions with $x \geq 0$ because many powers are not defined when $x&lt;0$.</p>
<p>In particular,  if the power is a rational number, or fraction, of the form $p =\color{blue}{n}/\color{green}{m}$ (and the power has been reduced) then the function is not defined when $x&lt;0$.  The reason for this is that fractional powers with even denominators are even roots, and even roots of negatives are not real numbers.</p>
<p>However, if the denominator $\color{green}{m}$ is odd then the function is defined for negative values of $x$. You can explore this in the interactive figure below.</p>

<p>Notice for an odd denominator $\color{green}{m}$, the function exhibits even symmetry when the numerator $\color{blue}{n}$ is even and odd symmetry when the numerator $\color{blue}{n}$ is odd.</p>
<p>So a quick look at the power helps us know where the function is defined and what type of symmetry it has.</p>

<h2 id="use-symmetry-to-graph-power-functions">Use Symmetry to Graph Power Functions</h2>
<p>Knowing how the values of $\color{blue}{n}$ and $\color{green}{m}$ impact the symmetry of $f(x)=x^{p}$ with $p = \color{blue}{n} / \color{green}{m}$ also allows us to quickly sketch the graph of a power function.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, $f(x) =  x^{\color{blue}{2}/\color{green}{3}}$.  The power $p =\color{blue}{2}/\color{green}{3}$ is between $0$ and $1$, so the graph of this function looks similar to the basic shape for $0&lt;p&lt;1$, which resembles the square root function.  The denominator $\color{green}{3}$ is an odd number, which tells us that this function has a left side.  And since the numerator $\color{blue}{2}$ is even, we should reflect the right side across the y-axis to create a graph with even symmetry.  Thus, the graph of $f(x) =  x^{2/3}$ looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_2_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>If the numerator had been odd, such as $f(x) =  x^{5/3}$ then we would have reflected around the origin instead, ending up with this rough sketch:</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_5_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that the shape of the right side of $f(x) =  x^{5/3}$ is similar to the right side of the square function, since $5/3&gt;1$.</p>
<p>In summary, to sketch the graph of a power function with a rational exponent, first choose the basic shape that matches the power $p$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_functions.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Then use the symmetry rules to draw the other half of the graph, if it exists.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the denominator $\color{green}{m}$ is odd, then the function also exists when $x&lt;0$ so it has a left side.</li>
<li>When $\color{green}{m}$ is odd, the function has even symmetry if $\color{blue}{n}$ is even and odd symmetry if $\color{blue}{n}$ is odd.</li>

<h2 id="inverses-of-power-functions">Inverses of Power Functions</h2>
<p>Finding the inverse of a power function is a very straightforward process.  As an illustration, consider the cube function $f(x) =  x^{3}$ and its inverse, the cube root function $f^{-1}(x) =  \sqrt[3]{x}$.</p>
<p>Since the cube root can be written as the one-third power $x^{1/3}$, the inverse of $f(x)=x^{3}$ is the power function $f^{-1}(x)=x^{1/3}$.</p>
<p>Notice that the two powers are <em>reciprocals</em> of each other, that is the key.</p>
<p>In general, the inverse of any power function is the power function whose power is the reciprocal of the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/reciprocal_power.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>That is to say, given some power function $f(x)=x^{p}$, then its inverse is always $f^{-1}(x)=x^{1/p}$, assuming $p\neq 0$.</p>
<p>Of course, if the function is not one-to-one (like in the case of $f(x)=x^2$), then we should restrict ourselves to a portion of the domain (usually $x \geq 0$) where the function is one-to-one.</p>

<h2 id="how-power-functions-change">How Power Functions Change</h2>
<p>Our last task for this section is to see if we can find any patterns in the way power functions change.</p>
<p>You will recall that the difference quotient $D(x)$ is a function that lets us calculate the average rate of change on a generic interval $[x, x+h]$, where $h$ is any positive number.  The difference quotient of a function is given by</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
D(x)=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Below are the difference quotients for the power functions $f(x)=x^2$ and $f(x)=x^3$.</p>

<p><em>Click the link under each difference quotient to see the steps required to arrive at the equation.</em></p>
<p>Notice that the difference quotient of each power function is similar to the next smaller power function.  In general, the difference quotient of $f(x)=x^p$ will involve the power function $f(x)=x^{p-1}$ for any $p\neq0$.  This is a fact that is verified in the first term of calculus.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In this section we discovered that the basic library functions could all be written in an identical algebraic form.  We then used that common form to create a new category of functions, whose properties we explored.   This is a process that will be repeated in later chapters as well.  We'll start with functions we understand and then create new functions that have slightly different algebraic forms and investigate their properties.</p>
<p>An understanding of the properties and behaviors of functions is essential when working with applications, which is where we will head next.</p>

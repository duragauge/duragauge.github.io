<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When the stock market opened on Monday, October 22, 2001, stock in Enron (a Fortune-500 energy company) was trading for about $20 per share.</p>
<p>At the same time stock in Apple (the electronics manufacturer) could be also be purchased for $20.</p>
<p>Without additional information, it would be natural to assume that state of both companies was the same.  In reality, however, they were headed in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Later that same day Enron announced they were being investigated for accounting irregularities.  Within weeks the company declared bankruptcy and several Enron executives were sent to prison for fraud and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, had an important announcement of their own.  The next day, on October 23, 2001, Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the very first iPod.  It was an iconic success that revolutionized the consumer electronics industry and helped establish Apple as one of the most innovative technology companies in the world.</p>
<h2 id="rates-of-change">Rates of Change</h2>
<p>Just like stocks, functions can increase and decrease in value.  In an <a href="../1.3#concavity">earlier section</a> we saw that graphs can be concave up, concave down, or even straight.  This is an indication that functions can change at different rates, or speeds.</p>
<p>For instance, an increasing function could grow at a steady rate, at a rate that quickens, or at a rate that slows.  All three options are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/increasing_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Functions can also decrease at constant, increasing, and decreasing rates.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/decreasing_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Our goal now is to develop tools that allow us to measure, compare and categorize functions based on their rates of change.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>For each of the scenarios below, decide if the rates of change would be increasing, decreasing or constant.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="total-change">Total Change</h2>
<p>The amount that a function has increased or decreased on an interval is called the <strong>total change</strong> of the function.   The symbol $\Delta y$ means the change in the y-values and will be used to represent total change.
<label for="sn-delta" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-delta" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">The upper-case Greek leter delta ($\Delta$) is used throughout math and science to indicate change.</span></p>
<p>To calculate the total change of a function on some interval $[a, b]$ we find the difference between the starting value $f(a)$ and the ending value $f(b)$.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$ \Delta y = f(b)-f(a)$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>The corresponding change in the x-values $\Delta x$ is the length of the interval $[a, b]$ which is given by</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$\Delta x = b-a$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>Both $ \Delta y$ and $\Delta x$ are illustrated in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/deltaY_deltaX.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Use the graph of $f(x)$ to answer the questions below.
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/total_change_question_graph.svg#center" alt=""></p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="percentage-change">Percentage Change</h2>
<p>The <strong>percentage change</strong> of a function $f$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is the ratio of the total change to the starting value.  We calculate percentage change as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>percentage change = $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{f(a)}$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>With this formula the percentage change is given in decimal form.  In other words, a value such as $0.12$ should be interpreted as $12\%$.  Also note that the percentage change cannot be computed if $f(a)=0$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Use the graph to help answer the questions below.

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="average-rate-of-change">Average Rate of Change</h2>
<p>The concepts of total change and percentage change are more useful when we average them across the length of the interval.  The resulting quantities describe per unit changes.  That is to say, by averaging we can tell what will happen to $f(x)$ every time $x$ increases by $1$.</p>
<p>You are probably already familiar with the basic process of finding averages.  For instance, if you drove a distance of 100 miles in 2 hours then your average speed would be $\frac{100 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}$.</p>
<p>Your actual speed may have gone up and down during the trip but, on average, your speed was 50 miles per hour.</p>
<p>To find the average change of a function we follow the same process and divide the total change of the function $\Delta y$ by the corresponding change $\Delta x$ in the input values to get $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$.</p>
<p>Since $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is a ratio, it is often called the <strong>average <em>rate</em> of change</strong> of a function.</p>
<p>To compute the average rate of change of a function $f$ over the interval $[a, b]$ we use the formula</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>[ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}  = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}]</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>To see how this works let's find the average rate of change of $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ on the interval $[9, 100]$.  Using the formula above we see that</p>
<p>[ \begin{align}
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{100} - \sqrt{9}} {100 - 9} \newline
&amp;= \frac{10-3}{91} \newline
&amp;= \frac{7}{91} \newline
&amp;\approx 0.077
\end{align}]</p>
<p>This means that from $x=9$ to $x=100$ the function $f(x)=\sqrt x$ increases, on average, by $0.077$ every time $x$ increases by $1$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Calculate the average rate of change of $f(x)=\sqrt x$ over the interval $[0,16]$.  <details style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />[ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{0}}{16-0}=\frac{4-0}{16}=\frac{1}{4}]</details></div>
<p>The average rate of change formula might look familiar.  That's because it is the same thing as the <em>slope</em> of the line connecting the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.  This line is called a secant line.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/secant.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>When a function is defined by a graph, the average rate of change can always be found by calculating the slope of the secant line.</p>

</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="patterns-of-change">Patterns of Change</h2>
<p>We can gain additional insight into the behavior of a function by looking for patterns of change.  One way to do this is to compute the total change of the function over several successive intervals that all have the same length.  In other words, when the input values are equally spaced, we will look for a pattern in the output values.  Typically we choose the length as $\Delta x = 1$, so that all the input values are $1$ unit apart, but any even spacing will work.</p>
<p>Suppose $f(x)=3x+2$.  Let's calculate the total change on number of intervals where $\Delta x=1$.  For simplicity, we will refer to these collectively as the <strong>first differences</strong> of the function. and see if some pattern emerges.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_1.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that the first differences are constant.  This will happen anytime the function is linear.</p>
<p>Let's go a bit further, and look at first differences for $f(x)=x^{2}$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_2a.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The first differences are not constant, which tells us that $f(x)=x^{2}$ is not a linear function.  But why stop with first differences?  The <strong>second differences</strong> are the differences between the first differences.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Here the second differences are constant.  The second differences of quadratic functions are always constant.</p>
<p>Based on these results, you might expect that the <strong>third differences</strong> of a cubic function will be constant.  And you would be right.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The temptation, however, is to assume that the differences will always be constant at some point, no matter which function we choose.  That would be a mistake, as the next example will illustrate.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_4.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>While there is a clear pattern, the differences never become constant.  Perhaps, what we should really look at with this function are the <em>percent</em> changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/percent_change_1.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Functions like this one, where the percentage change is constant, are called exponential functions, and we study them in <a href="//chapter-3/3.1">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Determine the first and second differences of the function $g$ given below.  What type of function is $g$?
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_quick_check.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<details style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" /><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_quick_check_answer.png#center" alt="">
Since the second differences are constant, $g$ is a quadratic function.</details>
</div>
<p>First and second differences also provide us a way to identify when it is increasing or decreasing and its concavity.</p>

<p>With this in mind, let's take another look at the first and second differences for the cube $f(x) = x^3$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_5.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that the first differences are all positive, suggesting that $f(x) = x^3$ is always increasing.  And since the second differences switch from negative to positive at $0$, we conclude that the function is concave down to the left of $0$ and concave up to the right of $0$.  We came to the same conclusions after a visual inspection in <a href="../1.3#the-cube-function">Section 1.3</a>, but now we have numerical evidence as well.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>What do the first and second differences of the square function $f(x)=x^{2}$ tell you about its behavior?
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<details style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Since the first differences switch from negative to positive at $0$, we can conclude that the square function decreases to the left of $0$ and increases to the right of $0$.  And since the second differences are always positive, the square function must be concave up over its entire domain.</details>
</div>
<h2 id="difference-quotients">Difference Quotients</h2>
<p>The formulas and tables we have used so far can only show what happens on a limited number of intervals.  What would be very helpful is a mechanism that has the potential to describing the behavior of the function on any interval all at once.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient.svg#center" alt="">
The tool that does this is called the <strong>difference quotient</strong>.  The difference quotient $D(x)$ is a function that lets us calculate the average rate of change on a generic interval from $x$ to  $\color{blue}{x+h}$, where  $\color{blue}{h}$  is any positive number.  To find the formula for the difference quotient we simply take the average rate of change formula</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/average_change.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>and substitute $x$ in place of  $a$, and $\color{blue}{x+h}$  in place of  $\color{blue}{b}$.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
\frac{f(\color{blue}{b})-f(\color{red}{a})}{\color{blue}{b}-\color{red}{a}} &amp;= \frac{f(\color{blue}{x+h})-f(\color{red}{x})}{\color{blue}{(x+h)}-\color{red}{x}} \newline \newline
&amp;= \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>The behavior of $D(x)$ will help us understand how $f(x)$ changes.  For instance, the value of $D(x)$ indicates whether the function is increasing, decreasing or constant.</p>
<ul>
<li>If $D(x)&gt;0$, then $f(x)$ in increasing.</li>
<li>If $D(x)&lt;0$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing.</li>
<li>If $D(x)=0$, then $f(x)$ is constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the way $D(x)$ changes tells us the concavity of the function.  Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>If $D(x)$ is increasing, then $f(x)$ is concave up.</li>
<li>If $D(x)$ is decreasing, then $f(x)$ is concave down.</li>
<li>If $D(x)$ is constant, then $f(x)$ is a straight line and $D(x)$ is the slope.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, let's see what the difference quotient has to say about $f(x)=3x+2$, which is an increasing linear function with a slope of $3$.  Hopefully the difference quotient will say the same thing.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient_3x+2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since $D(x)=3$ is always positive, we know that $f(x)$ is increasing over its entire domain.  And the fact that $D(x)$ is constant confirms what we already knew, that $f(x)$ is a straight line with a slope of $3$.</p>
<p>Let's now look at the difference quotient for $f(x)=x^{2}$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient_x_squared.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that no matter what value $h$ happens to be, $D(x)$ is an increasing linear function, so $f(x)$ is concave up over its entire domain.  When $D(x)&gt;0$, $f(x)=x^{2}$ will be increasing, and when $D(x)&lt;0$, $f(x)=x^{2}$ is decreasing.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>We have just seen that the difference quotient helps us identify function behaviors such as concavity and intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing.  As we introduce new functions in the next chapters, you will that functions with similar behaviors have similar difference quotients.</p>
<p>We will also use the difference quotient to efficiently compute <em>average</em> rates of change. Additionally, if you continue on to calculus, you will find that the difference quotient is used to calculate <em>instantaneous</em> rates change and is the foundation of the <strong>derivative</strong>, one of the most important concepts in calculus.</p>

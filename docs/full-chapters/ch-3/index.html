<p>Exponential functions have a type of growth that we have not studied yet, but you have probably seen it before.  Perhaps the best place to start is with an example.</p>
<p>The images below illustrate three different real world examples of exponential growth.  All three are exactly the same, just in a different context.</p>

<h2 id="exponential-growth">Exponential Growth</h2>
<h3 id="going-viral">Going Viral</h3>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/social.gif#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The videos and games on social media sites like YouTube and Facebook can often &quot;go viral&quot; when they experience a rapid increase in popularity.<br>
Imagine, for instance, that you share a video with two friends and each of them shares it with two new friends.  If that process continues then the number of new people viewing the video would follow the pattern:</p>
<p>[
1,  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  64, \dotsc
]</p>
<p>Notice that these numbers are doubling.  One doubles to get two, two doubles to get four, four doubles to get eight, and so on.  This type of increase is one example of <strong>exponential growth</strong>.</p>
<p>If the numbers were to consistently triple, for example $1, 3, 9, 27, \dotsc$, or quadruple like $1,\thinspace 4,\thinspace 16,\thinspace 64,\thinspace \dotsc$, that would also be considered exponential growth.</p>
<h3 id="nuclear-reactions">Nuclear Reactions</h3>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/chain_reaction.png#center" alt="">
A nuclear reaction begins when a small particle, called a neutron, crashes into an atom and splits it in half.  When that atom splits it releases more neutrons.  Those neutrons crash into other atoms and cause them to split as well.</p>
<p>If each atom that splits causes two more atoms to split, then the number of reactions would follow the pattern:</p>
<p>[
1,  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  64, \dotsc
]</p>
<p>Notice that these numbers are doubling.  One doubles to get two, two doubles to get four, four doubles to get eight, and so on.  This type of increase is one example of <strong>exponential growth</strong>.</p>
<p>If the numbers were to consistently triple, for example $1, 3, 9, 27, \dotsc$ or quadruple like $1,\thinspace 4,\thinspace 16,\thinspace 64,\thinspace \dotsc$, that would also be considered exponential growth.</p>
<h3 id="cell-division">Cell Division</h3>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/cell_division.png#center" alt="">
All living cells reproduce by cell division.  Once a cell matures, it then splits into two new cells.  These new cells can also split once they mature.</p>
<p>The number of cells would follow the pattern:</p>
<p>[
1,  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  64, \dotsc
]</p>
<p>Notice that these numbers are doubling.  One doubles to get two, two doubles to get four, four doubles to get eight, and so on.  This type of increase is one example of <strong>exponential growth</strong>.</p>
<p>If the numbers were to consistently triple for example $1, 3, 9, 27, \dotsc$, or quadruple like $1,\thinspace 4,\thinspace 16,\thinspace 64,\thinspace \dotsc$, that would also be considered exponential growth.</p>
<h2 id="exponential-decay">Exponential Decay</h2>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/World_Cup_Bracket_Large.gif#center" alt=""></p>
<p>In the 2010 FIFA World Cup, teams from 16 countries competed for the world championship of men's soccer.</p>
<p>In each round, the losing teams were eliminated from the tournament while the winners advanced to the next round.  This process continued until there was only one undefeated champion:  the Spanish national team.   The number of teams in each round followed the pattern:</p>
<p>[
16,  8, 4, 2, 1
]</p>
<p>Notice that these numbers are always halving.  One-half of sixteen is eight, one-half of eight is four, and so on.  This type of  decrease is an example of <strong>exponential decay</strong>.</p>
<p>If each number was always one-third or one-fifth of the previous number (for example $27, 9, 3, 1\thinspace$ or $\thinspace250, 50, 10, 2$) then that would also be considered exponential decay.</p>
<h2 id="linear-vs-exponential">Linear vs. Exponential</h2>
<p>These examples show us that exponential growth is special because each new value is a <em>multiple</em> of the previous one.  Contrast this with linear growth where each new value is the previous value <em>plus</em> a constant.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/linear_vs_exponential_growth_table.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>With linear growth, the number you add to move from one value to the next is called the <em>slope</em> and is usually represented by the letter $m$.  In exponential growth, the number we multiply by to move from one value to the next is called the <strong>growth factor</strong>.  We will use the letter $b$ to represent the growth factor.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Recall that the only difference between linear growth and linear decay is the sign of the slope.  If $m$ is positive, the line increases, or grows.  But if $m$ is negative, the line decreases, or decays.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the only difference between exponential growth and exponential decay is the value of the growth factor $b$.  Growth occurs when $b$ is large, whereas the function decays if $b$ is small.  Specifically, any growth factor $0&lt;b&lt;1$ will result in exponential decay.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/linear_vs_exponential__decay_table.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>If we know for certain that $0&lt;b&lt;1$, then we call $b$ a <strong>decay factor</strong>.  If no value of $b$ is specified, then we will use the term <em>growth factor</em> in a generic sense that could include the possibility of growth or decay.</p>

<h2 id="identify-characteristics-of-exponential-functions">Identify Characteristics of Exponential Functions</h2>
<p>Now that we can identify exponential growth, it's time to derive the basic equation for an exponential function.</p>
<p>Our first growth examples in this section followed the pattern $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,\dotsc$ where the growth factor is $b=2$ and each new value is twice the previous value.  If we recall that $1=2^0$, then a clear pattern emerges.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/exponential_growth_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Using function notation we might write this as $f(x) = 2^{x}$, which is nothing more than the growth factor $b=2$ raised to the power of $x$.  This gives us a clue for how the basic equation of an exponential function should look.</p>
<p>All exponential functions, whether they represent growth or decay, have the same basic form.  The basic form for an exponential function is</p>
<p>[
f(x) = b^{x}
]</p>
<p>The <strong>base</strong> of the function is the growth factor $b$, which can be any positive number.</p>
<p>We should be careful not to confuse an exponential function $f(x)=b^{x}$ with a power function $f(x)=x^{p}$.  Even though their equations look similar, they are completely different types of functions.  The key difference is that an exponential function has a variable $x$ in the exponent, whereas the exponent of a power function is a fixed constant.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Are any of the following exponential functions?  If so, identify the base $b$ and decide if the function grows or decays as $x$ increases.</p>

<p>The shape of the graph of an exponential function is controlled entirely by the value of the base $b$.

<li>Domain includes all $x$ values; the Range is $y&gt;0$.</li>
<li>All exponential functions have the same <strong>y-intercept</strong> of $y=1$. There are no <strong>x-intercepts</strong> since exponential functions never cross the x-axis.</li>
<li>If $b &gt; 1$ the function is always <strong>increasing</strong> and represents <strong>exponential growth</strong>.  Larger values of $b$ produce faster growth.  If $0 &lt; b &lt; 1$ the function is always <strong>decreasing</strong> and indicates <strong>exponential decay</strong>.  The decay is greatest when $b$ is close to $0$.

<h2 id="evaluate-exponential-functions">Evaluate Exponential Functions</h2>
<p>When we want to evaluate an exponential function we can often take advantage of the rules of exponents.  For instance, if $f(x)=2^{x}$ then</p>
<p>[
f(-3/2) =  2^{-3/2} =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{3}}} =  \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}
]</p>
<p>This is an <em>exact</em> expression for $f(-3/2)$.  Sometimes it may make sense to use a calculator to find an <em>approximate</em> decimal value instead.  In this case, $f(-3/2) \approx 0.3536$.</p>

<h2 id="how-exponential-functions-change">How Exponential Functions Change</h2>
<p>We said earlier that exponential functions $f(x)=b^{x}$ are special because each time $x$ increases by $1$ the value of the function is multiplied by a factor of $b$.  In other words, if $f$ is an exponential function, then</p>
<p>[
f(x+1)=b \cdot f(x)
]</p>
<p>You'll recall that this pattern was the key to identifying exponential growth and decay.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/exponential_growth_vs_decay_table.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This simple property, $f(x+1)=b \cdot f(x)$, is unique to exponential functions and causes them to change in a way that is different than any other type of function.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the percentage change of an exponential function $f$ over the interval $[x,\thinspace x+1]$.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Percentage change</th>
<th>[ \frac{f(x+1)-f(x)}{f(x)} ]</th>
<th><em>Percentage change formula.</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>[\frac{b \cdot f(x)-f(x)}{f(x)}]</td>
<td><em>Apply the property $f(x+1)=b \cdot f(x)$.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>[b-1]</td>
<td><em>Cancel the $f(x)$.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since $b$ is constant, $b-1$ is also constant.  This means that the percentage change from one value to the next is always constant.  Having a constant percentage change is one of the features that distinguishes exponential functions from all other functions.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>The percentage changes for two functions, $f$ and $g$, are shown below.<br>
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/percent_change_quick_check_b.png" alt="">
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/percent_change_quick_check_a.png" alt=""><br>
Which one is an exponential function? <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The first function $f$ is exponential because its percent change is constant.  The second function $g$ is likely a power function, since its percent change is decreasing.</details></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>For any exponential function $f(x)=b^{x}$ with a <em>growth factor</em> of $b$, the expression $b-1$ is called the <strong>growth rate</strong> of the function and is designated by the letter $r$.  For instance, if $f(x)=1.08^{x}$, where $b=1.08$, then the growth rate is $r=0.08$.</p>
<p>To see why the growth rate is important, let's take a look at the total change of a basic exponential function over the interval $[x, \thinspace x+1]$.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$\Delta y$</th>
<th>$= f(x+1)-f(x)$</th>
<th>Total change formula.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>$=b \cdot f(x)-f(x)$</td>
<td>Apply the property $f(x+1)=b \cdot f(x)$.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>$=f(x) (b-1)$</td>
<td>Factor out $f(x)$.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>$=r \cdot f(x)$</td>
<td>Substitute $r=b-1$.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This result indicates that difference between $f(x)$ and $f(x+1)$ is $r \cdot f(x)$.  In other words, to move from one value to the next you add $r$ times the current function value.</p>
<p>For instance, if $b=1.08$, then $f(x+1)=f(x) + .08f(x)$, meaning that every time $x$ increases by $1$, the function increases by $8\text{%}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Suppose $f(x)=1.26^{x}$.  Identify both the growth factor $b$ and the growth rate $r$. <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The growth factor is the base $b=1.26$.  The growth rate is $r=0.26$, meaning the  every time $x$ increases by $1$ the function increases by $26\text{%}$.</details></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Now let's examine the first, second, and third differences of an exponential function.  For convenience, we will use $f(x)=10^{x}$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/finite_differences_exponential_10.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that the first differences $9,90,900,9000,90000$ follow an exponential growth pattern with a growth factor of $b=10$.  The same is true for the second and third differences as well; each value is $10$ times the size of the previous one.</p>
<p>This is surprising.  Not only are the first, second, and third differences growing exponentially, but their growth factors are exactly the same as the growth factor of the original function $f(x)=10^{x}$.  To understand why exponential functions behave this way we must turn our attention to the difference quotient.</p>
<h2 id="difference-quotients-of-exponentials">Difference Quotients of Exponentials</h2>
<p>The difference quotient of an exponential function $f(x)=b^{x}$ can be simplified as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$D(x)$</th>
<th>$=  \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$</th>
<th>Difference quotient formula.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>$=  \frac{b^{x+h}-b^{x}}{h}$</td>
<td>Insert $f(x+h)=b^{x+h}$ and $f(x)=b^x$.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>$=  \frac{b^{x} b^{h}-b^{x}}{h}$</td>
<td>Rewrite $b^{x+h}$ as $ b^{x} b^{h}$.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>$=  b^{x} \left( \frac{b^{h}-1}{h} \right)$</td>
<td>Factor out $b^{x}$.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since $b$ and $h$ are constants, the expression $\frac{b^{h}-1}{h}$ is also a constant.  This means that the difference quotient of any exponential function is always proportional to the function itself.</p>
<p>This is certainly different from what we observed with power functions.  The difference quotient of a power function is related to a power function with a lower degree, not to the function itself.  For instance $x^{3}$ grows at a rate involving $x^{2}$.

<p>This shows that no mater which $h&gt;0$ we choose, $D(x)$ will always be a multiple of the original function $f(x)=10^{x}$.  For instance, choosing $h=1$ gives</p>
<p>[
D(x) = \left( \frac{10^{1}-1}{1} \right) 10^{x} = 9 \cdot 10^{x}
]</p>
<p>This particular result is what caused the pattern $9,90,900,9000,90000$ that we saw earlier in the first differences of $f(x)=10^{x}$.</p>

<p>Since every exponential function is proportional to its difference quotient, it's possible that there are special cases where the function and the difference quotient are identical. To pinpoint when this might happen, let's reexamine the equation for the difference quotient of $f(x)=b^{x}$.</p>
<p>[
D(x) =  \frac{b^{h}-1}{h} b^{x}
]</p>
<p>Notice that if  $\frac{b^{h}-1}{h}=1$, then $D(x)=b^{x}=f(x)$.    In other words, if we can find values of $b$ and $h$ that make $\frac{b^{h}-1}{h}=1$, then the difference quotient will equal the function.</p>
<p>Although there are many combinations of $b$ and $h$ that make $\frac{b^{h}-1}{h}=1$, the most important one arises when $h$ is chosen to be a very small, positive number.  In the interactive figure below, we have fixed $h = 0.001$.  Use the slider to adjust the value of $b$ until you find one where $\color{red}{D(x)}=f(x)$.</p>

<p>Which value of $b$ works? From the figure it appears that choosing $b$ somewhere around $2.718$ does the trick.</p>
<p>The true value is an irrational number known as $e$.   Since $e$ is an irrational number, $2.718$ is just an approximation of  it, much like $3.14$ is an approximation of $\pi$.  Before we can find more precise approximations of $e$, we need to define exactly what $e$ is.</p>
<p>The number $e$ was discovered a Swiss mathematician, Jacob Bernoulli, as he studied interest on loans, an application we will look at in the next section.  The name $e$ was given by another Swiss mathematician, Leonard Euler.</p>
<p>While there are many ways to define $e$, we choose to say that $e$ is the number which causes $\frac{b^h-1}{h}=1$ as $h \rightarrow 0$.  Solving this equation for $b$ will give us a variation of the formula Bernoulli used to discover $e$.</p>

<p>As $h&gt;0$ approaches zero, this expression approaches the number $e$.  That is to say,</p>
<p>[
(1+h)^{1/h} \rightarrow e \thinspace \text{  as  } \thinspace h \rightarrow 0
]</p>
<p>which is equivalent to one of the definitions Euler used.</p>
<p>The fact that $(1+h)^{1/h} \rightarrow e$ as $h \rightarrow 0$ allows us to find more precise approximations of $e$ by simply making $h$ closer to $0$.</p>

<p>Euler once approximated $e$ out to 18 decimal places as  $2.718281828459045235$, all <em>by hand</em>.   You do not need to memorize several digits of $e$, but remembering that $e \approx 2.718$ will give you a good approximation for making rough calculations.</p>
<p>Today $e$ is considered one of the most important numbers in mathematics and science.   It is used so frequently, that the exponential function with a base of $e$ is often called <em>the</em> exponential function, as though no other bases mattered.  You will find that your calculator as a button dedicated to evaluating $e^{x}$ for any real number $x$.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Imagine that you have a delicious mug of creamy, homemade hot cocoa that is, unfortunately, much too hot to drink.  How long should you leave it on your kitchen counter so that it cools but doesn't lose all of its comforting warmth?</p>
<p>We're not ready to answer that question yet, but it should not surprise you that it has to do with exponential functions!  In this section, we will develop variations of the basic exponential function that are used in applications as varied as radiation therapy, population growth and, of course, the cooling of hot cocoa.</p>
<p>But before we discuss these specific examples, we must first learn how to interpret the base of an exponential function and incorporate a few standard transformations.</p>
<h2 id="growth-factor-and-growth-rate">Growth Factor and Growth Rate</h2>
<p>You learned in the previous section that the base $b$ of an exponential function $f(x)=b^{x}$ is a growth factor.  For instance,  if $f(x)=1.08^{x}$, then the <em>growth factor</em> is $b=1.08$, meaning the function is multiplied by $1.08$ every time $x$ increases by $1$.</p>
<p>We can also say that each new value of $f(x)=1.08^{x}$ is $8 \text{%}$ larger than the current one.  This second interpretation focuses on the <em>growth rate</em> $r=b-1$ rather than the growth factor $b$.</p>
<p>In real world applications the growth rate is given much more frequently than the growth factor.  For instance, business commonly report that sales are up by $3 \text{%}$ or down by $5 \text{%}$, instead of announcing growth factors of $1.03$ or $0.95$.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is often useful to make the substitution $b = 1+r$ and write exponential functions in the form</p>
<p>[
f(x)=(1+r)^{x}
]</p>
<p>Note that growth occurs when $r&gt;0$ and decay occurs if $ -1&lt;r&lt;0$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

</div>
<h2 id="initial-value">Initial Value</h2>
<p>Another way to change the basic exponential function $f(x)=b^{x}$ is to apply a vertical stretch.  A vertical stretch by a factor of $a$ has the effect of multiplying each y-value by $a$. by multiplying the function by some constant $a$.  Use the figure below to explore the effect of multiplying $f(x)=2^{x}$ by a constant $a$.  Make a note of your observations before continuing.</p>

<p>You should have noticed that multiplying an exponential function $f(x)=b^{x}$ by a constant $a$ causes the y-intercept to change from $(0, 1)$ to $(0, a)$.  For instance, if $a=4$, then the y-intercept will be $(0, 4)$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/exponential_vertical_stretch.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This is actually a consequence of the rule of exponents that says $b^{0}=1$, so $f(0)=a \cdot b^{0} = a$ for any valid base.</p>

<h2 id="the-standard-exponential-model">The Standard Exponential Model</h2>
<p>By including a vertical stretch with the exponential form $f(x)=(1+r)^{x}$, we obtain a more general function</p>

<p>that starts with an initial value of $a$ and grows (or decays) at a constant rate $r$. We will call this equation the <strong>standard exponential model</strong>.  All other exponential functions are variations of this equation.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Write the equation for an exponential function with an initial value of $31$ that grows at a rate of $25 \text{%}$.  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Using $a=31$ and $r=0.25$, the function is $f(x)=31(1+0.25)^{x}$ or $f(x)=31(1.25)^{x}$.</details></div>
<p>Let's revisit an earlier example.  In the final stage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, 16 teams competed for the world championship.  After each round, one-half of the teams were eliminated and eventually Spain emerged as the champion.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/Spain_World_Cup_2.gif#center" alt=""></p>
<p>We now have the tools needed to model this scenario with the standard exponential model $f(x)=a(1+r)^{x}$.</p>
<p>Since the final stage of the World Cup starts with 16 teams, we know that $a=16$.  And if $50\text{%}$ the teams are eliminated after each round, then $r=-0.5$ and the function</p>
<p>[

<h2 id="half-life">Half-Life</h2>
<p>Our first variation of the standard model will enable us to work with applications that involve half lives and doubling times.</p>
<p>The <strong>half-life</strong> of a function is the amount of time needed for the value to be reduced by half.  Every exponential decay function has a half-life.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/half_life.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>For instance, the exponential decay function in this graph models the value of a sports car.  The initial value of $60,000 is cut in half every 3 years, so we would say it has a half-life of 3 years.</p>
<p>To make the standard model fit this situation we must stretch the $50\text{%}$ decay out over a three-year period.  In other words, we must stretch the function horizontally by a factor of $3$.  So we can model the value of this car with the function</p>
<p>[
f(x)=60000(1-0.5)^{x/3}
]</p>
<p>where $a=60000$ is the initial value and $r=-0.5$ is the growth rate.</p>

<h2 id="doubling-time">Doubling Time</h2>
<p>On the other hand, the <strong>doubling time</strong> of a function is the amount of time needed for the value to double.  Every exponential growth function has a doubling time.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/doubling_time.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Consider, for example, the value of a collectible toy car like the one shown in this graph.  We say that the value of this toy car has a doubling time of 5 years, since it's value doubles every 5 years.</p>
<p>To make the standard model fit this situation we must stretch the $100\text{%}$ growth out over a five-year period.  In other words, we need to stretch the function horizontally by a factor of $5$.  This means we can model the value of this toy car with the function</p>
<p>[
f(x)=2(1+1.00)^{x/5}
]</p>
<p>where $a=2$ is the initial value and $r=1.00$ is the growth rate.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Create an exponential function that starts at 10 and doubles every time $x$ increases by 4.</p>

<p>Let's generalize these last two examples.  If an initial quantity $a$ grows exponentially at a rate of $r$ every time $x$ increases by $c$, then that growth can be modeled by an exponential function of the form</p>
<p>[
f(x)=a (1+r)^{x/c}
]</p>
<p>For instance, the function $f(x)=18(1+0.64)^{x/7}$ could model an initial quantity of $18$ that increases by $64\text{%}$ every time $x$ increases by $7$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

<p>This new form $f(x)=a (1+r)^{x/c}$ gives us greater flexibility when modeling realistic scenarios.  Of particular interest is the case when $r=1$, which gives us the <strong>doubling time model</strong>,  and the case where $r=-1/2$, which is called the <strong>half-life model</strong>.</p>

to invest his tuppence (two pennies) in the bank with the following words of wisdom:</p>
<p><em>If you invest your tuppence, wisely in the bank <br>
Safe and sound <br>
Soon that tuppence, safely invested in the bank, <br>
Will compound.</em></p>
<p>Interest is <strong>compounded</strong> when it is added to the initial account balance, or <strong>principal</strong>.  Once that interest has been added to the principal it starts earning interest as well, compounding the effect.</p>
<p>In the financial world, it is common for interest to be compounded periodically throughout the year, sometimes on a monthly, weekly or even a daily basis.</p>
<p>If interest is compounded $n$ times a year, only a fraction $\frac{r}{n}$ of the annual interest is earned during each of those periods.  If there are $n$ interest periods per year, the number of periods in $t$ years would be $n \cdot t$. With this in mind, we modify the standard exponential model to create a function for working with <strong>periodic compound interest</strong>.</p>
<p>[
A(t) = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{n \cdot t}
]</p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>$A(t)$  is the account balance after t years</li>
<li>$P$  is the principal (initial balance)</li>
<li>$r$  is the annual interest rate (written as a decimal)</li>
<li>$n$  is then number of compounding periods per year (ie. 12 for monthly, 52 for weekly, 365 for daily, etc.)</li>
<li>$t$  is time in years</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if $3000 is invested at 6% compounded monthly for 8 years, the account balance would be</p>
<p>[
A(8) =  3000\left(1+\frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{12 \cdot 8}\approx 4842.43
]</p>
<p>When using a calculator, remember to include parenthesis around the exponent.</p>

<h2 id="continuous-compound-interest">Continuous Compound Interest</h2>
<p>It is logical to wonder what might happen if we were to increase the number of compounding periods $n$ over the course of a year.  Let's investigate.</p>
<p>Suppose you invest $\$25,000$ at $5\text{%}$ interest for one year.  Using $P=25000$, $r=0.05$ and $t=1$, the accompanying table shows the account balance $A$ for ever increasing values of $n$.</p>

<p>The table suggests that more frequent compounding does not produce unlimited growth over the course of a year.  For instance, compounding interest 365 times a year (every day) gives a balance of $26,281.69, which is only very slightly better than compounding just 12 times a year (every month).</p>
<p>It also appears that no matter how many times we compound interest, the balance never gets above $26,281.78.</p>
<p>To explain why more frequent compounding does not produce unlimited wealth, consider what happens to the equation $A(t)=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{n t}$ as $n
\rightarrow \infty$.  If $n$ gets larger, then $\frac{r}{n} \rightarrow 0$.</p>
<p>In the past we've used the letter $h$ for quantities that get close to zero.  We will follow that convention and make the substitution $h= \frac{r}{n}$.  Note that this implies $n=\frac{r}{h}$.  With these changes we rewrite $A(t)$ as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$A(t) =P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{n t}$</th>
<th><em>Start with the periodic compound interest function.</em></th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$ = P\big[(1+h)^{\frac{1}{h}}\big]^{ r t}$</td>
<td><em>Rewrite using the rule of exponents $x^{m n} = (x^m)^{n}$.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The expression in brackets $[(1+h)^{1/h}]$ might remind you of something from the previous section.  If $h \rightarrow 0$ then $(1+h)^{1/h} \rightarrow e \approx 2.71828$.  This is the reason for the limit.  Compounding interest more and more frequently makes the base closer and closer to $e$.  The resulting function</p>
<p>[
A(t)=P e^{r  \thinspace  t}
]</p>
<p>is known as the <strong>continuous compound interest formula</strong> and is widely used in finance, business and economics.</p>

<p>Aside from compound interest, there are many other quantities that change continuously.  For instance, the number of bacteria in a petri dish does not increase suddenly at the end of a day, week or month.  Rather the population increases continuously at a rate that is proportional to the size of population.</p>
<p>Similarly, the amount of carbon-14 in an object decays continuously.</p>
<p>When used in different settings such as these, the $A(t)=P e^{ r t}$  formula is often referred to as &quot;continuous growth&quot;.</p>
<p>In general, we will say a quantity that experiences <strong>continuous exponential growth</strong> (or decay) can be modeled by a function of the form</p>
<p>[
f(t)=a e^{ k t}
]</p>
<p>where $a$ is the initial quantity when $x=0$ and $k$ is the continuous rate of growth.</p>
<p>The continuous exponential growth function is often written with different letters to match specific application.  You will need to be able to recognize continuous growth regardless of how the function is written.  For example,</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
Q(x) &amp;= Q_0 e^{ k x} \newline
n(t) &amp;= n_0 e^{ r t} \newline
y &amp;= C e^{ r x}

<h2 id="unlimited-growth">Unlimited Growth</h2>
<p>In general, exponential growth cannot be sustained unless there are unlimited resources.   For this reason it is sometimes called <strong>unlimited growth</strong>.  A historic example of this is &quot;tulipmania&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/tulip_price_index.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>During the 1630's, Holland was crazy for tulips and their value skyrocketed exponentially.  At one point, tulip prices were as much as 20-times higher than they had been just months before.  Some economists estimate that half of all the money in the Dutch economy was wrapped up in the tulip market.  Such a huge exponential rate of growth was not sustainable and soon the tulip market crashed, bankrupting many Dutch citizens.</p>
<p>In the next few examples we look at situations where, instead of exploding, the growth is limited and eventually levels off.  Surprisingly, exponential functions are at the center of those applications as well.</p>

    <a href = "https://www.pexels.com/photo/baked-pizza-on-pizza-peel-in-oven-905847/">Photo by Eneida Nieves from Pexels</a></span>
</div>
<br>
<p>Suppose you put a pizza in a 450°F oven.  The temperature of the pizza will increase, but in a limited way since it will never exceed the temperature of the oven.  Isaac Newton studied situations like this and discovered a law that modeled the heating or cooling of an object.</p>
<p><strong>Newton's law of cooling</strong> says that rate of temperature change in an object is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings.  Based on this, Newton found that the temperature of an object at time $t$ is given by</p>
<p>[
T(t) = S + (T_{0} - S)e^{-k  \thinspace t}
]</p>
<p>where $S$ is the temperature of the surroundings (or the temperature of the oven, in this case) $T_{0}$ is the initial temperature of the object (or the original temperature of the pizza), and $ k $ is a positive constant that depends on the nature of the object.</p>
<p>This function models cooling when $T_0 &gt; S $ and heating if $T_0 &lt; S$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/newtons_law.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>In either case, $y = S$ is a horizontal asymptote.  Also notice that the resulting curves are nothing more than exponential functions that have been reflected and/or shifted vertically.</p>
<p>Let's consider a cooling example.  Suppose you put a 160°F hot cup of cocoa on the counter in a 70°F kitchen.  The cocoa will cool according to Newton's law of cooling as it approaches room temperature.</p>
<div style="position:relative; clear:both; padding:0;">
  <img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/hot_cocoa.jpg"  title="Hot cocoa photo by Rawpixels on Unsplash"  alt="Hot cocoa photo by Rawpixels on Unsplash" style="display:block; width:100%; height:auto;" >

    <a href = "https://unsplash.com/photos/UbMl1U1KvvA">Hot cocoa photo by Rawpixels on Unsplash</a></span>
</div>
<br>
<p>Assuming $k=0.08$, what will be the temperature of the cocoa in 20 minutes?</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
T(t) &amp;= S+(T_0-S)e^{-k  \thinspace  t} \newline
&amp;=70 + (160-70)e^{-0.08 \cdot 20} \newline
&amp;=70 + 90e^{-1.6} \newline
&amp;\approx 88.17
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>We conclude that after 20 minutes the temperature of the cocoa is roughly 88°F.</p>
<h2 id="logistic-growth">Logistic Growth</h2>
<p>Our final variation of the standard exponential model has its roots in population growth.</p>
<p>Imagine that a small number of trout are introduced into a large lake.  When the population is small, the amount of food and resources available appears unlimited, and the population grows exponentially.  But as the population increases, resources become more scarce and the growth levels off.</p>
<p>In 1838, Belgian mathematician Pierre-Francois Verhulst created a function that has this very behavior.  His function, now called the <strong>logistic function</strong>, assumes growth is proportional to both the current population size and the available resources.  The equation and graph of a logistic function are given below.  The values $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/logistic.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The number $c$ is a horizontal asymptote of the function and is often called the <strong>carrying capacity</strong>.  In the trout example, it would represent the maximum number of trout that the lake can support.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Suppose the population of trout in a particular mountain lake is modeled by the logistic equation $f(x)=\frac{20000}{1+39e^{-0.2x}}$ where $x$ is the number of years since the lake was first stocked.</p>

in the 1970's, people relied on 300-year-old mechanical calculators called &quot;slide rules&quot;.</p>
<p>Slide rules use the properties of exponents to simplify calculations.  For example, multiplication turns into addition and division becomes subtraction.</p>
<p>To build a slide rule you need a function that can extract exponents.  Such functions are called <em>logarithmic</em> functions and just happen to be the inverses of exponential functions.  In this section we will study logarithms and even learn how to use a simple slide rule.</p>
<h2 id="definition-of-logarithms">Definition of Logarithms</h2>
<p>We learned in a <a href="//chapter-1/1.4">previous chapter</a> that every one-to-one function has an inverse.  Since the exponential function $b^{x}$ (where $b&gt;0$ and $b\neq1$) is one-to-one, it must have an inverse.</p>
<p>The inverse of the exponential with base $b$ is called the <strong>logarithm</strong> with base $b$ and is written $\log_b (x)$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/inverse_exp_log.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>As with exponential functions, the base $b$ must be a positive number not equal to $1$.</p>
<p>In other words, as long as the base is the same, the functions $b^{x}$ and $\log_b(x)$ are inverses of each other.</p>

<h2 id="convert-between-exponential-and-logarithmic-equations">Convert Between Exponential and Logarithmic Equations</h2>
<p>Whenever a function has an inverse, we know that $f(x) = y$ if and only if $f^{-1}(y) = x$.   In the present context, this inverse relationship means that $b^{x} = y$ is equivalent to $\log_{b}(y) = x$.</p>
<p>This gives us the ability to rewrite exponential equations as logarithmic equations and/or convert logarithmic equations into exponential equations.

<p>The inverse relationship</p>
<p>[
y=b^{x} \Longleftrightarrow \log_{b}(y) = x
]</p>
<p>can also be used to evaluate logarithms by rewriting known exponential values. To illustrate this point, let's compute a few values of $\log_{2}(x)$ by looking at known values of $2^{x}$.</p>

<p>Notice that in each instance the logarithm is the exponent.  For example, $\log_{2}(8)=3$ because $3$ is the exponent that makes $2^{x}=8$.</p>
<p>Of course, logarithmic functions can also be evaluated on a calculator.  Starting with the <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/HP-35_large.jpg">HP-35</a> in 1972, two different logarithms have been built into every handheld scientific and graphing calculator: the <strong>common log</strong> and the <strong>natural log</strong>.

<h2 id="understand-how-logarithmic-functions-change">Understand How Logarithmic Functions Change</h2>
<p>Every time we define a new function, we need to investigate the way it changes.   Let's start by looking at the average rate of change $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ over several intervals.</p>
<p>For convenience, we will use the common logarithm $\log(x)$ and, to simplify the calculations, we will choose intervals $[a, b]$ that have a width of $\Delta x=1$.</p>

<p>What do these values for $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ in the table tell us about the common logarithm function?  It appears that $\log(x)$ changes more when $x$ is small than it does when $x$ is large.  In other words, the values of $\log(x)$ are further apart when $x$ is small, and closer together when $x$ is large.  The difference quotient will help us understand why this happens.</p>
<h2 id="difference-quotient-of-logarithmic-functions">Difference Quotient of Logarithmic Functions</h2>
<p>In earlier chapters we saw that the difference quotient of a function, given by $D(x)=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$, is a function that describes how $f$ changes on any interval of length $h&gt;0$.</p>
<p>Unlike power functions and exponential functions, it is very difficult to simplify the difference quotient of a logarithmic function by hand, so we will not attempt that.</p>
<p>However, since $D(x)$ is itself a function, we can take a look at its graph and see if it has any interesting properties.</p>
<p>It the figure below, the graphs of $f(x)=\log_{b}(x)$ and its difference quotient $D(x)$ are shown in <span style="font-weight: bold;color:black;">black</span> and in <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red">red</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>We have fixed $h=0.001$, but the value of the base $b$ can change, allowing us to view the difference quotient for several different logarithms.  Use the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:blue">blue</span> slider to change the value of $b$ and see if you recognize $D(x)$ as one of the basic functions from <a href="//chapter-1/1.3#the-reciprocal-function">Chapter 1</a>.</p>

<p>No matter which base is chosen, the graph of $D(x)$ always looks like the reciprocal function $1/x$.  And the fact that $1/x$ is large when $x$ is small but small when $x$ is large confirms our earlier observation that logarithmic functions change rapidly when $x$ is small but that the rate slows down as $x$ increases.</p>
<h2 id="logarithmic-scales">Logarithmic Scales</h2>
<p>When we plot values for $\log (x)$ on a number line it quickly becomes apparent that they are not evenly spaced.  The smaller values are spread out while the larger values are more compressed.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/log_scale_a.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>If we use the logarithms as increments and relabel the axis we end up with something called a <strong>logarithmic scale</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/log_scale_b.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Logarithmic scales have several applications, some of which will be covered in the next section.  For now, we will use it like a ruler to measure lengths.  In the process, we hope to uncover at least one property of logarithms.</p>
<h2 id="product-rule-for-logarithms">Product Rule for Logarithms</h2>
<p>We now turn our attention to some rather useful properties that deal with combining logarithms through addition and subtraction.  Rather than deriving these properties by rewriting rules of exponents, we will attempt to discover some of them by using the logarithmic scale in this interactive figure.  Keep in mind that since <em>logarithms are exponents</em>, we cannot expect the normal rules of addition to work.</p>

<p>Start by adding two logarithms.  For instance, find $\log(3) + \log(5)$ by putting both $\log(3) $ and $\log(5)$  end-to-end on the log scale.  Is the answer $\log(8)$ ?    Experiment with other combinations to see if there is a pattern for addition.</p>
<p>Then move on to expressions like $\log(9) - \log(3)$.  Since you are not given a bar for $\log(9)$ you might have to find multiple bars that add up to $\log(9)$ before you subtract $\log(3)$ away from them.</p>
<p>Use a calculator to check your work and make a note of your results before continuing.</p>
<p>Let's look closely at what you might have found from the interactive figure.  This is what it would look like if you placed $\log(3) $ and $\log(5)$  end-to-end on the log scale.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/log3_plus_log5.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that the resulting bar lines up with $15$ on the log scale.  We learn from this that $\log(3)+\log(5)=\log(15)$ or,  in other words,</p>
<p>[
\log(3)+\log(5)=\log(3 \cdot 5)
]</p>
<p>If you try this with other values you will find that it is always true.  The pattern is</p>
<p>[
\log(x)+\log(y)=\log(x \cdot y)
]</p>
<p>and is called the <strong>product rule</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="quotient-rule-for-logarithms">Quotient Rule for Logarithms</h2>
<p>Since addition always tells us something about subtraction, let's take another look at $\log(3) + \log(5)$.<br>
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/log3_plus_log5.png#center" alt="">
We know that $\log(3)+\log(5)=\log(15)$, but what if we were to remove the $\log(5)$ from the figure above?  The only thing left would be $\log(3)$.   In other words, $\log(15)-\log(5)=\log(3)$.
Since $\frac{15}{5}=3$ the pattern for subtraction is
$\log(x)-\log(y)=\log\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)$
which is known as the <strong>quotient rule</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="power-rule-for-logarithms">Power Rule for Logarithms</h2>
<p>One of the most useful logarithm properties is called the <strong>power rule</strong>.  Consider what happens when you add $\log(3)$ with another $\log(3)$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/power_rule.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Clearly $\log(3)+\log(3)=\log(9)$.  And since $9=3^2$, this result can also be given as $\log(3)+\log(3)=\log(3^2)$.</p>
<p>But it is also proper to write $\log(3)+\log(3)=2 \cdot \log(3)$, just as we might write $5+5=2*5$.</p>
<p>Putting the two together we see that $\log(3^2)=2 \cdot \log(3)$.   The general pattern is</p>
<p>[
\log x^{p}=p \cdot \log(x)
]</p>
<p>and will be used extensively throughout the rest of this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="tables-of-logarithms">Tables of Logarithms</h2>
<p>When <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/John_Napier_%28Neper%29.jpg">John Napier</a> discovered logarithms in 1614, he realized that with these logarithm rules, every operation could be converted to a simpler one.</p>
<p>The power rule changes multiplication into addition; the quotient rule turns division into subtraction; and the power rule replaces powers with multiplication.</p>
<p>The only tool needed to use these simplifications is a table of logarithmic values.</p>
<p>To illustrate how to use a table of logarithms, we'll examine a very simple case.  Suppose we wanted to multiply $2$ and $3$.  Rather than doing the multiplication, we look up the two logarithms in the table and calculate their sum:  $\log(2) + \log(3) = 0.301 + 0.477 = 0.778$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/log_table.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, we scan through the table until we find $0.778$.  Lastly, we read the table backward to find the $x$ next to $0.778$.  This value, $x = 6$ is the answer to our multiplication problem!</p>
<p>What we just did was a product rule: $\log(2)+\log(3)=\log(2 \cdot 3)$.  And while our example was overly simple, the time saved when working with large numbers is tremendous since adding large numbers by hand is much faster than multiplying them.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Explain how you could use the above table and the properties of logarithms to evaluate the following:</p>

So we find $\log(3)=0.477$ on the table and double it: $2 \cdot 0.477=0.954$.  Next we look for $0.954$ and read it backward to get $x=9$ as our answer.</details></p>

<h2 id="slide-rules">Slide Rules</h2>
<p>Calculations became even faster after the invention of <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/wooden_sliderule.gif">slide rules</a>.</p>
<p>Slide rules look like standard rulers except that the markings are not evenly spaced.  Instead, the distances are proportional to the logarithms of the marked values.   In essence, a slide rule is nothing more than two logarithmic scales, one placed on top of the other so they can slide back and forth.</p>
<p>Let's see how this works.  Suppose you wanted to multiply $2 \cdot 3$.  The first step is to slide the top scale to the right until the $1$ is above the $2$.  Next move the hairline so that it is over the $3$ on the top scale.  The answer, $6$, will be directly below on the lower scale.</p>

<p>Sliding the upper scale is a physical way to add logarithms and use the product rule.  And while it may not be as precise as a table, it is very quick.  Notice that no extra work is needed to calculate other multiples of $2$ because  all the numbers on the top scale are now lined up with their multiples on bottom scale.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Modern calculators and computers have rendered both logarithm tables and slide rules obsolete.</p>
<p>However, the properties of logarithms that were developed in this section are valuable tools for solving exponential equations.</p>
<p>We will also return to logarithmic scales, but with a slight twist, at the end of the next section.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The human senses are capable of perceiving a wide range of stimuli.  Our sense of hearing, for example, picks up both faint whispers and highly amplified music.</p>
<p>One reason for this is the fact that your ears don't perceive the actual intensity of sound, rather they respond approximately to logarithm of the sound intensity.  For example, if you increase the intensity of a sound 10 times, it will only sound about twice as loud.</p>
<p>In this section we will discuss several applications of logarithms including the decibel scale, which is used to measure the intensity of sound.</p>
<h2 id="logarithmic-scales">Logarithmic Scales</h2>
<p>When measuring quantities that vary greatly, like sound intensity, it's often convenient to work with logarithmic scales.  As we saw earlier, one of the nice features of logarithmic functions is that they expand small values and condense larger ones.  Observe, for instance, the values of $\log(x)$ given in this table.</p>
<table>

<p>Even though each $x$ value increases by a factor of 10, the $\log x$ values only increase by $1$.  By using a logarithmic scale we can view a large range of data values without having to use enormous numbers.</p>
<p>Because of the convenience of a 10-fold increase, most logarithmic scales use $\log$ rather than $\ln$.  This is true of the pH scale, the Richter scale, the stellar magnitude scale and the decibel scale, which we will examine next.</p>

<p>Sounds that cause unbearable pain are about <em>10 trillion times</em> more intense than the faintest sounds that can be heard.  With such a wide range, using the actual values is not very convenient.</p>
<p>Realizing this, engineers at Bell Telephone Laboratories developed the decibel

<span class="sidenote">A decibel is one tenth (deci-) of a <b>bel</b>, a unit named after Alexander Graham Bell, and is abbreviated as dB.</span>
scale in the 1920's to rank the intensity of sounds with respect to the lowest sound level a listener can detect, called the <em>threshold of hearing</em>.</p>
<p>To find the decibel level (in dB) of a sound we use the formula</p>
<p>[
D = 10\log\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)
]</p>
<p>where $I$ is the intensity of the sound being ranked and $I_0$ is the threshold of hearing, both measured in watts per square meter.  And while hearing ability varies from person to person, it is generally accepted that $I_0=10^{-12}$ watts per square meter.</p>
<p>As an example, the sound of a typical household vacuum cleaner has an intensity of $10^{-4}$ watts per square meter.  On the decibel scale this would measure
[
\begin{align}
D &amp;= 10 \log \left( \frac{10^{-4}}{10^{-12}}\right) \newline
&amp;= 10 \log \left(10^8\right) \newline

<p>One of the oldest logarithmic scales is the apparent magnitude scale used for measuring the brightness of stars.</p>
<p>It dates back at least to the Greek astronomer Hipparchus who categorized stars into 6 magnitudes, from weakest ($6$) to brightest ($1$).  The stars in each magnitude were roughly twice as bright as those in the prior magnitude.</p>
<p>Today astronomers have a precise magnitude scale and use the following equation to calculate the apparent magnitude $m$ of a star in a particular color of light:</p>
<p>[
m=-2.5  \log \left(\frac{F}{F_{0}}\right)
]</p>
<p>In this formula $F$ is the observed flux (ie. brightness) of a star and $F_0$ is a reference flux in the same color.  Flux is usually given in watts per square meter.  When working with visible light, we use the brightness of the star Vega as the reference flux: $F_0=2.8\times10^{-8}$  watts/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that we wanted to find the apparent magnitude of the Sun, which has a flux of $1340$ watts/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>[
m=-2.5  \log \left( \frac{1340}{2.8\times10^{-8}}\right)\approx-26.7
]</p>
<p>This number might seem low at first, but remember that the apparent magnitude scale puts the brightest objects low on the scale and the weakest objects at the top.</p>

<h2 id="the-richter-scale">The Richter Scale</h2>
<p>In the early 1930's, Charles Richter was attempting to measure the strength of earthquakes in California.  He soon came to the conclusion that the range between the largest and smallest earthquakes was &quot;unmanageably large&quot;.</p>
<p>At that point a colleague suggested he plot the amplitudes logarithmically.  Even though Richter felt that &quot;logarithmic plots are a device of the devil&quot;, he gave them a try and soon &quot;I saw that I could now rank the earthquakes one above the other. ... This set of logarithmic differences thus became the numbers on a new instrumental scale.&quot; (See <i>Earthquake Information Bulletin, Volume 12, Issue 1, 1980.</i>)</p>
<p>On the Richter scale the magnitude $R$ of an earthquake is given by 
<label for="mn-earthquake list" class="margin-toggle">⊕

<p>[
R=\log\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)
]</p>
<p>where $I$ is the earthquake's reading on a <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/seismograph.jpg">seismograph</a>, an instrument used to measure the motion of an earthquake.</p>
<p>Richter arbitrarily chose $I_0$ to be an earthquake whose reading shows a 0.001 millimeter movement on a seismograph that is 100km away from the center of the earthquake.  Due to the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the intensity of the quake.</p>

<h2 id="work-with-log-plots">Work with Log Plots</h2>
<p>Even though Charles Richter felt they were a &quot;device of the devil&quot;, we will now take a moment to introduce log plots.  In a standard plot both, axis are linear and the increments are evenly spaced.  With log plots one, or perhaps both, of the axes are logarithmic scales.</p>
<p>A log plot is called a <strong>linear-log</strong> plot when the x-axis is linear and the y-axis is logarithmic.  A log plot is called a <strong>log-linear</strong> plot when the x-axis is logarithmic and the y-axis is linear.  Both of these are sometimes referred to as <em>semi-log</em> plots.</p>
<p>A <strong>log-log</strong> plot has logarithmic scales for both axes.  It is not a semi-log graph.</p>
<p>To help illustrate the difference, the points $(1, 2)$, $(2, 9)$, $(3, 5)$, $(4, 35)$, $(5, 80)$, $(6, 6)$ and $(7, 65)$ have been plotted below on all three types of log plots as well as on a standard graph.  Click any graph to enlarge it.</p>

<p>Log plots are often used in laboratory science classes like physics and chemistry.  Their usefulness lies in the fact that exponential, logarithmic, and power functions can all appear linear when graphed on the proper log plot.</p>
<p>To see how this works, we will plot points from an exponential function on a standard plot, where both axis are linear, and also on a linear-log plot, where the x-axis is linear but the y-axis is logarithmic. In this example we will use the function  $y=0.1 \cdot 2^{x}$.</p>

<p>The key point here is that if a log-linear plot of data is linear, then the data follows a logarithmic pattern and can be modeled by a logarithmic function.
This is especially useful since logarithmic functions and root functions often have similar shapes.</p>

<h2 id="solve-exponential-equations">Solve Exponential Equations</h2>
<p>Another major use of logarithms is found in solving exponential equations.  Here we aim to explain the basic principles at work.  A  number of detailed examples and techniques will be discussed <a href="../3.5">Section 3.5</a>.</p>
<p>Because logarithms and exponentials are inverses of each other, the following cancellation properties hold:</p>
<p>[
\log_b(b^{x})=x \text{  for all   } x
]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>[
b^{\log_b(x)}=x  \text{  for  } x&gt;0
]</p>
<p>These properties imply that taking a logarithm and exponentiation are <em>inverse operations</em>, as long as the bases are the same.</p>
<p>For example, applying the base $10$ logarithm is the opposite of applying the base $10$ exponential.  Thus, an expression like $\log_{10}(10^{\pi})$ simplifies to $\pi$, because the log cancels the exponential.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>One way to solve an exponential equation is to apply a logarithm with the same base to both sides, so that we can apply the cancellation properties.</p>
<p>For instance, to solve $3^{x}=100$, we can take the base-3 logarithm of both sides and simplify.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$3^{x} =100$</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$\log_3(3^{x}) = \log_3(100)$</td>
<td><em>Apply $\log_3$ to both sides.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$x = \log_3(100)$</td>
<td><em>Use the cancellation property.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The only difficulty with this method is that we do not have a convenient way to approximate $\log_3(100)$.  It would be nice if we could rewrite this value using either the common or natural logarithms, for then we could use the <code>LOG</code> or <code>LN</code> buttons on a calculator.</p>
<p>Whenever we encounter an exponential equation such as $3^{x}=100$, we should always consider <em>taking the natural logarithm $ln$ of both sides</em>.  Since logarithms are one-to-one, taking the natural logarithm of both sides does not change the solution.  It does however, allow us to reformat the equation using the power rule.  After using the power rule, the equation will be much simpler to solve.</p>
<p>To illustrate how this is done, we will solve the exponential equation $3^{x}=100$ for $x$.</p>
<table>

<th>$3^{x} =100$</th>

<tr>

</tr>
</tbody>

<p>We chose $\ln$ simply because most calculators have a <code>LN</code> button.  Had we used a $\log$ or any other logarithm for that matter, the answer would have been the same.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Use your calculator to verify that <code>log(100)/log(3)</code> gives the same value as <code>ln(100)/ln(3)</code>.

The base of $\log$ is $10$ while the base of $\ln$ is $e$, so they are not the same function.  However, since all logarithms share the same properties (such as the power rule), either one can be used to solve an exponential equation.</details></li>

<h2 id="change-of-base-formula">Change of Base Formula</h2>
<p>We have just solved the equation $3^{x}=100$ three different ways.  One answer was $x=\log_3(100)$, another was  $x=\frac{\ln(100)}{\ln(3)}$, and in the last <strong>QUICK CHECK</strong> we saw that $x=\frac{\log(100)}{\log(3)}$ is also a solution.  How do we reconcile these three solutions?</p>
<p>Since all exponential functions are one-to-one, the equation $3^{x}=100$ can only have one solution, and we are forced to conclude that <em>all three are equal</em>:</p>
<p>[
\log_3(100)= \frac{\ln 100}{\ln 3}=\frac{\log 100}{\log3}
]</p>
<p>What we have discovered is a way to evaluate $\log_{3} 100$ by utilizing either $\ln$ or $\log$.</p>
<p>In practice, we can evaluate a logarithm with any base by rewriting it as an expression involving $\ln$ or $\log$.</p>
<p>[
\log_{b}(x)=\frac{\log(x)}{\log(b)}
]</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>[
\log_{b}(x)=\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}
]</p>
<p>We use $\log$ or $\ln$ simply because calculators have <code>LOG</code> and <code>LN</code> buttons.  In theory, any other logarithm $\log_{a}$ could be used:</p>
<p>[
\log_{b}(x)=\frac{\log_a(x)}{\log_a(b)}

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since exponential and logarithmic functions arise in many applications, it is essential to be able to manipulate and solve equations involving them.  As an example of the type of problems we might encounter, consider the following situation.</p>
<p>A patient who is undergoing diagnostic imaging for thyroid cancer typically swallows a capsule containing the radioactive isotope Iodine-123 shortly before being placed inside a scanner.  The scanner detects radiation from the Iodine-123 and constructs a 3D image of the area being scanned, which is used by doctors to plan treatment options.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of using Iodine-123 is that it has a relatively short half-life of approximately 13.2 hours.  This means that within 13.2 hours, one-half of the Iodine-123 will be gone.</p>
<p>If a patient is given 400 microcuries of Iodine-123, how long will it take for the radiation level to drop to a negligible 10 microcuries?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we need to be able to solve the exponential half-life equation</p>
<p>[
10=400\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/13.2}
]</p>
<p>In this section, we will learn techniques for solving equations like this, where the variable is in the exponent, as well as equations involving logarithms. Once we have established the basic techniques, we can return and solve questions like this one.</p>
<h2 id="techniques-for-solving-exponential-equations">Techniques for Solving Exponential Equations</h2>
<p>There are three main techniques for solving exponential equations.  But before solving any exponential equation we should first isolate the exponential expression.</p>
<h3 id="first-step-isolate-the-exponential">First Step: Isolate the Exponential</h3>
<p>When working with more complicated exponential equations it is often necessary to perform some algebraic simplifications first in order to isolate the exponential expression.</p>
<p>As an example, let's examine the equation $500(1.2)^{x}=3000$.  Here the exponential expression $(1.2)^{x}$ has been multiplied by $500$.  If we divide both sides of the equation by $500$, then we will have isolated $1.2^{x}$.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
500(1.2)^{x} &amp;= 3000 \newline
1.2^{x} &amp;= 6 &amp;&amp;  \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide by } 500} \newline
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>At this point we can choose an appropriate solving technique from the choices discussed below.  But this initial step of isolating the exponential is always an essential first step.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="solving-method-1-the-one-to-one-property-of-exponentials">Solving Method 1: The One-to-One Property of Exponentials</h3>
<p>One technique for solving an exponential equation is to take advantage of the fact that all exponential functions are one-to-one.  This means that</p>
<p>[
b^N=b^M \text{ if and only if }N=M
]</p>
<p>So if we can express both sides of an equations as powers of the same base, then the one-to-one property tells us that the solution can be found by comparing the exponents.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to solve $7^{x+3}=49$.  We can do so by writing both sides as powers of $7$ and equating the exponents.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
7^{x+3} &amp;= 49 \newline
7^{x+3} &amp;= 7^2 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{{\text{Rewrite }} 49=7^2} \newline
x+3 &amp;= 2 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text {One-to-one property of exponentials}} \newline
x &amp;= -1 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{-3 \text{ from both sides}}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>Notice that this method only works when both sides can be written easily as powers of the same base.  If the equation had been just slightly different, say $7^{x+3}=50$, we would not have been able to solve it easily with this technique.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Solve the exponential equation $2^{x-1}=8$ by relating the bases.    <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />[

\end{align}
]</details></div>
<h3 id="solving-method-2--rewrite-as-a-logarithmic-equation">Solving Method 2:  Rewrite as a Logarithmic Equation</h3>
<p>Another useful technique is to rewrite an exponential equation as an equivalent logarithmic equation using the definition of a logarithm.</p>
<p>[
b^{x}=y \Longleftrightarrow \log_{b}(y) = x
]</p>
<p>For instance, if we start with the equation $3^{x}=10$ then rewriting it as a logarithm gives us the solution $x = \log_3{10}$, which could be evaluated using the change of base formula.
<label for="sn-Change of Base" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-Change of Base" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">[ \log_b(x)=\frac{\log(x)}{\log(b)}=\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)} ]</span>
The complete process would look like this:</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
3^{x} &amp;= 10 \newline
x &amp;= \log_3(10) &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Rewrite as a log equation}} \newline
x &amp;= \frac{\ln(10)}{\ln(3)} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Change of base formula}} \newline
x &amp; \approx 2.0959 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Evaluate}} \newline
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>We could have used $\log$ for the change of base formula and still arrived at the correct answer, but $\ln$ will be our default choice.</p>

<h3 id="solving-method-3-take-the-logarithm-of-both-sides">Solving Method #3: Take the Logarithm of Both Sides</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most useful technique for solving an exponential equation is to take the logarithm of both sides.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we start with $3^{x}=10$ and take the natural log of both sides.
[
\begin{align}
3^{x} &amp;= 10 \newline
\ln\left(3^{x}\right) &amp;= \ln(10)  &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Apply } \ln \text{to both sides}}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>While this might seem worse than the original equation, it is actually better because we can now apply the power rule for logarithms
<label for="sn-Power Rule" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-Power Rule" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">[ \log_b x^{p} =  p \log_b (x) ]</span>
and bring the $x$ out of the exponent.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
\ln\left(3^{x}\right) &amp;= \ln(10) \newline
x \cdot \ln(3) &amp;= \ln(10) &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Power rule for logs}}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>The final step is to divide both sides by the number $\ln(3)$.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
x \cdot \ln(3) &amp;= \ln(10)  \newline
x  &amp;= \frac{\ln(10)}{\ln(3)} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide by } \ln(3)} \newline
x  &amp;\approx 2.0959 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Evaluate}}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>Notice that the last two lines are exactly the same as when we solved this earlier with the change of base formula.  One of the nice features of this technique is that the change of base formula is built in, so you do not need to memorize it.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Solve the same equation $3^{x}=10$ using $\log$ instead of $\ln$.

<p>This method has an extra benefit if the base of the exponential in the equation is $e$.</p>
<p>If we start with the equation $e^{2x}=17$, as an example, then when taking the natural log of both sides we are able to use the inverse property of logs

<p>Now that we have established the basic techniques for solving exponential equations, let's return to the section opener.</p>
<p>We want to know how long it will take for the radiation level to drop to 10 microcuries given an initial dose of 400 microcuries of Iodine-123.  Since we know that the half-life of Iodine-123 is 13.2 hours, we will use the half-life formula to write our equation:</p>
<p>[
10=400\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/13.2}
]</p>
<p>Our task is to solve this equation for $t$.  The first step is to isolate the exponential.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
10 &amp;= 400\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/13.2} \newline
\frac{10}{400}  &amp;=  \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/13.2} &amp;&amp;  \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide by } 400} \newline
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>Now we have to decide which method to use to solve the equation. Since it is not obvious how to write both sides as powers of $\frac{1}{2}$, and converting it to a logarithm equation looks like it would be messy, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
\frac{10}{400}  &amp;=  \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/13.2} \newline
\ln \left(\frac{10}{400} \right) &amp;= \ln \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/13.2} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Apply } \ln} \newline
\ln \left(\frac{10}{400} \right) &amp;= \frac{t}{13.2} \ln \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Power rule for logs}} \newline
\frac{\ln \left(\frac{10}{400}\right)}{\ln \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} &amp;= \frac{t}{13.2} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide by } \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} \newline
t &amp;= 13.2 \frac{\ln \left(\frac{10}{400}\right)}{\ln \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Multiply by } 13.2} \newline
t &amp;\approx 70.249 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Evaluate}}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>This means that it will take 70.249 hours (roughly 3 days) for the radiation level to drop from 400 to 10 microcuries.</p>

<p>When solving real life problems, we usually will not be given the equation directly.  When this happens, we must construct it from the information available and our knowledge of appropriate models.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose you have invested $5000 in an account earning 2% interest compounded continuously.  How long will it take for your investment to double?</p>
<p>Since this question involves continuously compounded interest, we should use the continuous growth model $A(t)=P e^{r t}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Based on the information given, what are the values for $P$, $r$ and $A(t)$?  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The initial deposit is 5000 dollars, so $P=5000$.  The rate is given as 2%, so $r=0.02$.  The balance of the account should be double the initial deposit, so $A(t)=10000$.  Substituting those values into $A(t)=P e^{r t}$ will let us solve for the time it takes for the investment to double.</details></div>
<p>Making the substitutions $P=5000$ and $r=0.02$ we see that the account balance for any $t$ is given by $A(t)=5000e^{0.02 t}$.  We need to find $t$ so that $A(t)=10000$.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
10000 &amp;= 5000 e^{0.02 t} \newline
2 &amp;= e^{0.02 t} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by } 5000} \newline
\ln(2) &amp;= \ln(e^{0.02 t}) &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Apply } \ln \text{ to both sides}} \newline
\ln(2) &amp;= 0.02 t &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use the inverse relationship } \ln(e^{x})=x} \newline
\frac{\ln(2)}{0.02} &amp;= t &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by } 0.02} \newline
t &amp;\approx 34.657 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Decimal approximation}} \newline
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>We have found that it will take close to 35 years for the investment to double if it earns 2% continuously.</p>

<p>Let's consider a similar example.  When Google went public in 2004 you could by a share of stock for $85 .</p>

<p>This means that over the 2-year period from 2004 to 2006, Google's stock increased at a continuous rate of 75.79%.</p>

<h3 id="radioactive-decay">Radioactive Decay</h3>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/piltdown.gif#center" alt=""></p>
<p>In 1912, men working in an English quarry discovered what appeared to be a prehistoric human skull.  Piltdown Man, as the fossil was known, seemed to be a clear indication that the human species had originated in England and was considered by many to be the &quot;missing link&quot; in the history of human evolution.  But was it really?</p>
<p>The age of fossils is often determined by a process called <em>carbon dating</em>.  Plants absorb small amounts of the radioactive isotope carbon-14 from the atmosphere.  People and animals collect carbon-14 when they eat plants and other animals.  Once they die, however, the amount of carbon-14 begins to decay exponentially with a half-life of about 5730 years.  By comparing the amount of carbon-14 in a fossil with the amount that would have been been present when it was alive we can estimate the fossil's age.</p>
<p>Suppose that you were able to get a small fragment of the bone and extract $9.7 \times 10^{-15}$ grams of carbon-14 out of it.  If there would have been $1.05 \times 10^{-14}$ grams present when Piltdown Man was alive, how old is this fossil?</p>
<p>To solve this we will use the half-life formula $f(t) = a \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/c}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Use the information above to write the equation that we must solve.  Keep in mind that $a$ is the initial value, $c$ is the half-life, and $f(t)$ is the amount after some period of time.   <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Taking $a = 1.05 \times 10^{-14}$, $c = 5730$ and $f(t) = 9.7 \times 10^{-15}$, the equation that must be solved is

<p>As this result suggests, Piltdown Man was an elaborate forgery.  Someone had cleverly stained and carved the bones to look old, though this fact was not discovered for more than 40 years.  And while the perpetrator has never been determined, there are several suspects, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (author of Sherlock Holmes) who lived nearby.  In any case, Piltdown Man remains one of the greatest unsolved scientific hoaxes of all time.</p>

<p>During the 1950's, the number of active nuclear warheads in the U.S. arsenal doubled every 2.27 years. If there were 369 nuclear warheads in 1950, when did the U.S. stockpile exceed 30,000?</p>
<p>As we are given the doubling time, it makes sense to use the function $f(t)=a(2)^{t/c}$ with $a=369$, $c = 2.27$ and to try and find a $t$ so that $f(t)=30000$.</p>

<p>So if the number of nuclear warheads since 1950 is given by $f(t)=369(2)^{t/2.27}$, then our work suggests the United States had a stockpile of more than 30,000 warheads some time in the spring of 1964.</p>

<h1 id="techniques-for-solving-logarithmic-equations">Techniques for Solving Logarithmic Equations</h1>
<p>While our primary focus has been solving exponential equations that arise from different applications, we should also discuss solving logarithmic equations.</p>
<p>Just as with exponential equations, it's usually best to try and simplify the equation first.</p>
<h3 id="use-log-properties">Use Log Properties</h3>
<p>If an equation contains multiple logarithms, we should start by using log properties to condense those into a single logarithm, if possible.</p>
<p>For instance, the left side of the equation $\log(x+39)-\log(4x) = 1$ could be condensed using the quotient rule.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
\log(x+39)-\log(4x) &amp;= 1 \newline
\log\left(\frac{x+39}{4x}\right) &amp;= 1 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Quotient rule for logs}}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>At this point we can choose an appropriate solving technique from the choices discussed below.  But this initial step of trying to condense multiple logarithms is always something we should look for first.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>
<p>Use the product property to write the left side of the equation $\ln 8 + \ln x = 7$ as a single logarithm.  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />$\ln(8x)=7$</details></p>

<h3 id="solving-method-1-the-one-to-one-property-of-logarithms">Solving Method 1: The One-to-One Property of Logarithms</h3>
<p>Since logarithms are one-to-one functions, if we know that two logs with the same base are equal then their inputs must also be equal.</p>

]</p>
<p>In other words, as long as both sides are written as single logarithms with the same base, then the logarithms themselves can be ignored.</p>
<p>For example, solving the equation $\log_2(x^{2}+1) = \log_2(26)$ is equivalent to solving $x^{2}+1 = 26$ as we see below.</p>

<h3 id="solving-method-2-rewrite-as-an-exponential-equation">Solving Method 2: Rewrite as an Exponential Equation</h3>
<p>Another solving technique is to isolate the logarithmic expression and rewrite the equation as an equivalent exponential using the definition of a logarithm.</p>

]</p>
<p>Consider the equation $4 \log_3(x-2) = 16$.  If we divide both sides by $4$ then the logarithm will be isolated and we can solve by rewriting it as an exponential equation.</p>

<h3 id="solving-method-3-exponentiate-both-sides">Solving Method 3: Exponentiate Both Sides</h3>
<p>Our final method is to exponentiate both sides of the equation using the base of the logarithm.</p>
<p>To <em>exponentiate</em> both sides of an equation means to turn each side into an exponent of the base $b$.  Once that has been done we can take advantage of the inverse property between logs and exponentials.

<p>Earlier we would have solved this by rewriting it as the exponential equation $x=2^6$ and simplifying to see that $x=64$, and rewriting is probably the preferred method.  We introduce the idea of exponentiation here to reemphasize the inverse relationship between exponentials and logarithms.  Not only are they inverse functions, but it can sometimes be useful to think of exponentiation and taking the logarithm as inverse operations.  Exponentiating can then be viewed as just another operation we can use when we solve equations by reversing the order of operations.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Exponentiate both sides of the equation $\ln(x) = 4$.  Simplify if possible.  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The base of the natural logarithm is $e$, so we will place both sides of the equation into the exponent of an $e$.  $e^{\ln(x)} = e^{4}$ But $e$ and $\ln$ are inverses, so this simplifies to $x=e^4$ which is the same answer we would get by converting $\ln(x) = 4$ to an exponential equation.</details></div>
<h2 id="find-inverses">Find Inverses</h2>
<p>As we learned earlier, we can find an inverse by listing the operations performed by the function and doing the <em>opposite operations in the reverse order</em>.  Viewing exponentiation and logarithms as opposite operations allows us to find the inverses of more complicated exponential and logarithmic functions.</p>
<p>For instance, the function $f(x)=5(3)^{x+2}$ does three things to each input value.  It adds $2$, then exponentiates with a base of $3$, and lastly multiplies by $5$.  It's inverse should divide by $5$, then apply the base $3$ logarithm, and finally subtract $2$.  We summarize this in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Many people are concerned about the amount of mercury they ingest by eating fish such as shark, swordfish, and tuna.  Mercury levels in large fish can be over a million times higher than that found in the surrounding waters.  Fortunately, most things that we eat have biological half-lives and can be modeled using the functions we've learned about in this chapter.</p>
<p>In this section we will also learn how fit exponential, logarithmic, or logistic functions to data and use those models to make predictions.</p>
<h2 id="convert-between-exponential-models">Convert Between Exponential Models</h2>
<p>When working with exponential models it is important to realize that there are many ways to write the same function.  Specifically, the following models are equivalent.</p>

<p>It is possible to convert from one form to the other using $b=e^{k}$ or $k = \ln (b)$.  Either form can be used for any application.  The only difference is whether its preferable to emphasize the growth factor $b$ or the continuous growth rate $k$.  It is even possible to switch to a doubling time or a half-life model.</p>

Mercury levels in large fish can be over a million times higher than that found in the surrounding waters.</p>
<p>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) believes that if a person has a blood mercury level under 5.8 micrograms per liter ($\mu$g/L) then they are relatively safe and should see no adverse effects.</p>
<p>Suppose the Mercury level in your blood is at 15 $\mu$g/L.  If 5 days later it has only dropped to 14  $\mu$g/L, how long will it take to reach a safe level?</p>
<p>If we assume mercury leaves your body in a continuous fashion, then we can try to find a model of the form $f(t)=ae^{k t}$.  From the information given we can find $k$ by solving  $14=15e^{k \thinspace 5}$.</p>

<p>For instance, in 1970 the total population of Wheeler county in central Oregon was just 1849 people. By 1990, that number had dropped to 1396 people. Assuming that the population decays exponentially, we can use an exponential regression program like <code>ExpReg</code> to find an exponential model for the given data.</p>
<p>The steps for doing this will vary depending on the calculator used.  You will want to become familiar with the instructions for your calculator.  The basic process should be similar to the steps you used in previous chapters for  <code>LinReg</code> , <code>QuadReg</code>  and <code>PwrReg</code>.</p>
<p>Since the initial population given is from 1970, it makes sense let our variable $x$ be years since 1970.  After entering the data and running <code>ExpReg</code></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/expreg_1.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>we see that the population of Wheeler county Oregon can be modeled by the function $f(x)=1849(0.986)^{x}$, where $x$ is years since 1970.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Using this model, interpolate the population for 1980.  How does this prediction match the actual US Census value of 1513 people?  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Since 1980 is in between our two data points, we expect that interpolating the value for 1980 should be reasonably close.  With $x = 10$ we get
[f(10) = 1849(0.986)^{10 \approx = 1606] which isn't too far off the actual US Census value of 1513.</details></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Let's use our model $f(x) = 1849(0.986)^{x}$, where $x$ is years since 1970, to predict the population of Wheeler county in 2010.  Using $x = 40$ we have</p>
<p>[
f(40) = 1849(0.986)^{40} \approx 1052
]</p>
<p>meaning that our model predicts that the population should have been 1052 people in 2010.  But according to the US Census, Wheeler county actually had 1441 residents in 2010!</p>
<p>Inaccuracies like this are a risk any time we extrapolate our results far into the future, especially if the model is built on limited data.  A more reasonable approach would be to gather all of the available census data and then make a model.  The data and scatterplot below includes US Census data from 1970 through 2010.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/wheeler_scatterplot.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>It's not clear from the scatterplot that an exponential function would match the shape of the data.  What we seem to need is a function that can go down and up and then down again.  In Chapters 4 and 5 we'll discover polynomial functions which increase and decrease any number of times.</p>
<p>Even though polynomials will eventually let us find a function that fits this data exactly, it still may not be a good predictor of the future.  This uncertainty is one of the difficulties in modeling real life situations.</p>
<p>As we have just seen, it is best to include as much data as possible and consider the shape of the data before selecting a model.  We can then compare the shape of the data to the shape of known functions and decide which model to use.  For instance, the three data sets below appear to follow exponential, logarithmic, and logistic trends.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/scatterplots.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Remember, it is easy to mistakenly identify data that comes from a power function as having an exponential or logarithmic trend.  The log transforms and log plots discussed in can help us be fairly confident in the nature of the data.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2005, Road and Track magazine gathered 13 cars, 1 motorcycle, and a Navy F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet for a one-mile long acceleration test at the Lemoore Naval Air Base in California.  The first-placed Lola Champ Car (yellow car on the bottom right) crossed the finish line in just 24.2 seconds!  The following table show how long it took the Lola to reach different speeds.</p>

<p>Which would fit the data better: an exponential model, a logarithmic model, or a logistic model?  To find out, we start by creating a scatterplot of the data.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/standing_mile_scatterplot.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at the scatterplot helps us narrow down the list of possible models.  For instance, the data does not appear to be linear, so no attempt will be made at running <code>LinReg</code> and trying to fit a line to the data.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Of all the functions you've seen, which one(s) do you think have a shape similar to the shape of this scatterplot?</li>
</ol>
<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Of the shapes we have seen, this might match a logarithmic function, a logistic function, or even a quadratic.  In a moment we will try each of these and choose the one that appears to fit best.</details>
</div>
<p>In an attempt to find a function that models the speed of the Lola Champ Car (bottom right), we have run a natural log regression <code>LnReg</code>, a logistic regression <code>Logistic</code>, and a quadratic regression <code>QuadReg</code>.  The equations and graphs are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/standing_mile_regressions.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>It appears that the logistic function $f(x) = \frac{201.91}{1+6.31 e^{-0.334x}}$ is very close to each point, and we choose it as the best fit.  The carrying capacity $201.91$ of the model also seems to match up closely with the top speed $203.3$ of the car, even though it is not an exact match.  Since all models are an approximate fit, we should not expect them replicate every data point exactly.</p>
<p>Let's consider one final example.</p>
<p>The majority of teachers in primary education (K-12) are women. However, positions in K-12 administration, such as principal or superintendent, are more frequently held by men. The following data, from Indiana's department of education, shows the percentage of women in K-12 administration.

<p>A scatterplot of the data shows an increasing, concave down trend.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/educator_scatterplot.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Due to the shape, we can eliminate linear and exponential models from consideration.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Based on the shape of the data in the scatterplot, which type of function do you think would be the best fit? <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The shape is similar to a logarithmic function, but it is also reminiscent of a power function with a power $0&lt;p&lt;1$, like the square root function.  It might also be worthwhile to see if a logistic function might fit.</details></li>

<p>Before running any regressions, we stop to point out that our normal practice letting $x$ represent years since 1990 could be problematic, since $0$ is not in the domain of any logarithmic function.  To eliminate that possibility, we let $x$ represent years since 1989.  Now all of our $x$ values are positive.</p>

<p>Based on the curve of the data, we chose to run a logistic regression <code>Logistic</code>, a logarithmic regression <code>LnReg</code>, and a power regression <code>PwrReg</code>.  The results are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-3/educator_regressions.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>All three models match the data fairly well.  However, the logistic function has a significant flaw.  Remember that the carrying capacity $c$ is a horizontal asymptote.  In this case, the logistic model would never predict a percentage of female administrators that exceeds the carrying capacity of 40.866%.</p>
<p>Consequently, either the logarithmic or the power models might be better predictors of future trends.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In this section we have modeled data with exponential, logarithmic, and logistic functions.  Along the way we encountered a data set that went down, then up, and then down again.  None of the functions we have studied so far have that type of behavior.
However, by using combinations of power functions and exponential functions we can create new functions that have much more complex behaviors.  Combining functions will be the focus of the <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/chapter-4/">next chapter</a>.</p>

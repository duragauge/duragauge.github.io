<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Smithsonian in Washington, DC is one of the largest museums in the world, with vast collections of rare and historically significant objects.</p>
<p>The Air and Space collection, for instance, includes pioneering firsts like the <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/nasm_A19610048000">1903 Wright Flyer</a> and the <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/nasm_A19700102000">Apollo 11 Module</a>.</p>
<p>In other collections you might find <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/nmah_1199660">Abraham Lincoln’s top hat</a> or an original <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/nmah_765593">Kermit the Frog</a> puppet or the <a href="https://www.si.edu/spotlight/hope-diamond">Hope Diamond</a>. All told, the Smithsonian has more than 200 million fossils, specimens and treasures.</p>
<p>These collections help preserve our nation’s history and culture, and are important to researchers and scientists.</p>
<p>Collections are also important in math, though you seldom find them in a museum.</p>
<h2 id="sets">Sets</h2>
<p>In mathematics collections are usually called <strong>sets</strong>.  Sets are considered to be the foundation of modern mathematics.</p>
<p>All you need to create a set is a way of deciding if an object is part of the collection or not.</p>
<p>One way to do that is to list all the elements of the set.  For instance</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/set_colors.svg#center" alt="the set of colors on a traffic light"></p>
<p>is the set of colors on a traffic light.
<label for="sn-note about braces" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-note about braces" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">Sets are always enclosed in curly braces $\lbrace \thinspace \thinspace \rbrace$.</span></p>
<p>It can also be helpful to draw a set as a diagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/set_colors_diagram.svg#center" alt="the set of colors on a traffic light"></p>
<h2 id="set-builder-notation">Set-Builder Notation</h2>
<p>Sometimes it's hard to list everything in a set.  For instance, $\text{whiskers on kittens}$, $\text{bright copper kettles}$ and $\text{warm woolen mittens}$ might be a few of my favorite things, but listing all my favorites would be impossible.  What we do instead is describe the set using words</p>
<p>[
\left\lbrace \text{my favorite things} \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>If we want to talk about a generic element of the set we include a variable like $x$ and write it as</p>
<p>[
\left\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is one of my favorite things} \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>This last example is called <strong>set-builder notation</strong>.  The vertical bar symbol $\vert$ is shorthand for &quot;such that&quot; or &quot;where&quot;.  If we put the set above into words we would read it as &quot;the set of all $x$ <em>where</em> $x$ is one of my favorite things.&quot;</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Describe the following set in words and list a few items that are in the set:
[
\left\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is something in your backpack} \right\rbrace
]</p>
<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />This is the set of all $x$ where $x$ is something you might need in math class.  Elements in this set could include note paper, a pencil, a calculator, etc.</details>
</div>
<h2 id="combining-sets">Combining Sets</h2>
<p>Sets can be combined in two different ways. The first way is to group everything from both sets together into one big set, called the <strong>union</strong> of the two sets.  In the figure below you can form the union of the two sets by moving the <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> slider.</p>
<div class="no-print geogebra" style="padding-top: 20%;margin-bottom:0.5rem; ">

</div>
<p>The union of some set $A$ with another set $B$ is written using the union symbol: $\bigcup$.</p>
<p>[
A \bigcup B = \left\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is in } A  \text{ or }  x \text{ is in }B  \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>The second way to combine sets is to only consider items that the two sets have in common. This is called the <strong>intersection</strong> of the sets.</p>
<div class="no-print geogebra" style="padding-top: 20%;margin-bottom:0.5rem; ">

</div>
<p>The intersection of two sets also has its own symbol: $\bigcap$.</p>
<p>[
A \bigcap B = \left\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is in } A  \text{ and }  x \text{ is in }B\ \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>If the intersection has nothing in it we say it is <em>empty</em> and use the symbol $\varnothing$ to represent the <strong>empty set</strong>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Consider the following sets
[
\begin{align}
A &amp;= \lbrace \text{flour, sugar, butter, eggs, milk} \rbrace \newline

<h2 id="counting">Counting</h2>
<p>It might be hard to imagine, but people have not always had numbers. The numbers we use today are actually the result of thousands of years of innovation and invention.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, sets actually come before numbers. To see why this is the case, take a look at the following sets.  What do they have in common?</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/sets_of_3.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>These sets are similar because they are the same size.  Even though their contents are different, the <em>quantity</em> of items in each set is identical.  In other words, they have the same <strong>number</strong> of items.</p>
<p>It's this need to count the objects in a set that initiated the development of numbers.</p>
<h2 id="development-of-numbers">Development of Numbers</h2>
<p>Undoubtedly fingers were among the earliest counting tools.  In fact, the English the words <em>eleven</em> and <em>twelve</em> come from the Old English words for &quot;one left over&quot; and &quot;two left over&quot;, indicating how many would be left after using all ten fingers.</p>
<p>Over time people developed other tools to help them keep track of their flocks, herds, and other commodities.  These ranged from simple tally marks on a stick to small tokens or figurines carved to look like sheep, goats, jars of oil, baskets of grain, and so on.
<label for="sn-tokens" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-tokens" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/tally_sticks.jpg" alt=""> Tally sticks and tokens from the Swiss Alpine Museum. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SAM_PC_1_-_Tally_sticks_1_-_Overview.jpg"><em>Photo by Sandstein.</em></a></span></p>
<p>Artifacts in Mesopotamia suggest that about 10,000 years ago the Sumerians started using clay tokens shaped to resemble the items they were exchanging, one token for each item.  Soon these tokens were replaced by drawing shapes on clay tablets.</p>
<p>Eventually symbols (<em>numerals</em>) were created for specific quantities which eliminated the need to make one mark for each item. It was at that point, around 5000 years ago, that the first number system was born.

<span class="sidenote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/Sumerian_tablet.png" alt=""> This 5000 year-old clay tablet is one of the first artifacts in history to display numerical symbols.  It records how much beer should be paid to a particular worker for his labor. <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=327218&amp;partId=1">Photo courtesy of the British Museum</a> </span></p>
<p>The Sumerian system did not look like the one we use today.  It used a base of 60 (which is why we have 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour) but only had symbols for &quot;one&quot;, for &quot;ten&quot;, and for &quot;sixty&quot;.  To write  other values you repeated those symbols as needed.</p>
<p>The numbers we use today originated in India and were later adapted by Arab scholars. Because of it's origins our system is called the Hindu-Arabic system.</p>
<p>The Hindu-Arabic system has 3 key features:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a base-10 system, meaning only the ten symbols $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ are used.</li>
<li>The position of a digit determines its value. For example, the $2$ in $238$ stands for $2$-hundreds, the $3$ means $3$-tens and the $8$ is for $8$-ones.</li>
<li>$0$ is used both as a number and as a placeholder so that, for instance, $407$ can be visually distinguished from $47$.</li>
</ol>
<p>It wasn't until the 15th and 16th centuries that Europe began to embrace Hindu-Arabic numerals. Subsequent colonization, commerce and scholarly communication have spread the system across the world.</p>
<h2 id="natural-numbers-and-integers">Natural Numbers and Integers</h2>
<p>The numbers we are most familiar with are the counting numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, ...$.</p>
<p>The set of counting numbers is also known as the <strong>natural numbers</strong> and is represented by the symbol $\mathbb{N}$. In set notation we would say</p>
<p>[
\mathbb{N} = \left\lbrace 1,2,3,...\right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>You might already know that when we add two natural numbers the result is also a natural number. For example, $3$ and $5$ are both natural numbers and so is $3+5=8$.</p>
<p>But what if we subtract one natural number from another, is the result always in $\mathbb{N}$?  Clearly not, since subtraction can result in negative values.</p>
<p>The set that combines $\mathbb{N}$ with $0$ and all the negative natural numbers $ \left\lbrace ..., -3, -2, \right\rbrace$ is called the set of <strong>integers</strong> and is represented by the symbol $\mathbb{Z}$.</p>
<p>[
\mathbb{Z} = \left\lbrace ...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,... \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>We can add and subtract integers as much as we like and the result will always be an integer.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>

Since multiplication is repeated addition/subtraction, the answer will always be an integer.</details></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="rational-numbers">Rational Numbers</h2>
<p>While multiplying two integers always results in another integer, division is more complicated.</p>
<p>If $p$ and $q$ are integers, then the fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ could be an integer, but it doesn't have to be. For instance $\frac{6}{2}=3$ is an integer, but $\frac{5}{2}$ is not.</p>
<p>The set that contains all the fractions, or ratios, of integers, is called the set of <strong>rational numbers</strong>, or $\mathbb{Q}$.</p>
<p>[
\mathbb{Q} = \left\lbrace \frac{p}{q}  \thinspace \bigg|  \thinspace {p} \text{ and } {q} \text{ are integers with } q\neq0 \right\rbrace.
]</p>
<p>Since division by $0$ is not well defined, ratios like $\frac{4}{0}$ and $\frac{-2}{0}$ are undefined and not included in the set of rational numbers.</p>
<p>Also notice that since any integer can be written as a fraction, the set of rational numbers includes all of the integers.</p>
<p>Rational numbers may be written as fractions or as decimals. The decimal expansion of a rational number will either terminate or eventually have a pattern that repeats forever, as these examples illustrate:
[
\begin{align}
\frac{3}{16} &amp;=0.1875 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal terminates}} \newline \newline
\frac{1}{3} &amp;=0.\overline{3} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal repeats}} \newline \newline
\frac{1}{7} &amp;=0.\overline{142857} &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal repeats}} \newline \newline
\frac{10}{5} &amp;=2 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal terminates}}
\end{align}
]
The set of rational numbers is special because you can add, subtract, multiply and divide as much as you want and never end up with a different type of number---the answer will always be a rational number.</p>

<h2 id="real-numbers">Real Numbers</h2>
<p>Since the rational numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, it might come as a surprise that other types of numbers exist and are essential to mathematics.  The discovery of one new type of number is attributed to an associate of Pythagoras whose name was Hippasus of Metapontum.</p>
<p>According to legend, Hippasus was trying to measure the diagonal of a 1 by 1 square
<label for="sn-sqrt_2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sqrt_2" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/sqrt_2.svg#center" alt=""></span>
.  He knew from the Pythagorean theorem that the answer was $\sqrt{2}$, but had been unable to find a rational number that was equal to $2$ when you square it.</p>
<p>Eventually he proved that $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be written as a ratio of any two integers and concluded that it must belong to a set of <strong>irrational numbers</strong>.</p>
<p>Some accounts say that the other Pythagoreans were so shocked by Hippasus' discovery that they drowned him in the Mediterranean Sea in an attempt to hide irrational numbers from the world.</p>
<p>Even though irrational numbers cannot be written as fractions, we can still represent them as decimals. The decimal expansion of an irrational number never ends and never repeats. For example, $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.414213562...$.</p>
<p>The union of the rational and irrational numbers is called the set of <strong>real numbers</strong>, $\mathbb{R}$.  In other words, the set of real numbers includes every type of number we've discussed so far.</p>
<p>For example, $-0.5$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\frac{7}{3}$, $-0.248$, and  $8.\overline{261}$ are all real numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/real_numbers.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The set of real numbers is closed under all standard operations including powers and some roots.  In fact, you can do just about anything to a real number and the result will still be a real number, as long as you do not take the square root of a negative value, something we will look into in a <a href="//chapter-5/5.2#imaginary-numbers">later chapter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-number-line">The Real Number Line</h2>
<p>It is often helpful to visualize the set of real numbers with a <strong>number line</strong>, which is nothing more than a straight line with marks representing the location of numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/numberline_plain.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Positive numbers are always on the right side of zero, negative numbers are always on the left, and arrows indicate that the line continues in both directions.</p>
<p>Every real number has a place on the number line, and every location on a number line is assumed to correspond to a real number.  Here are a few real numbers and their relative locations on the number line.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/numberline_real_numbers.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="intervals-of-real-numbers">Intervals of Real Numbers</h2>
<p>The set of all values in between two numbers is called an <strong>interval</strong>.  For instance, all of the numbers between $0$ and $3$ make an interval.</p>
<p>There are several ways to describe this interval.  One way is to use inequalities and write it as a set.</p>
<p>[\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace 0&lt;x&lt;3  \rbrace]</p>
<p>Another option is to color the interval on a numberline</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/interval_open_0_to_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Open circles indicate that the numbers $0$ and $3$ are <strong>not</strong> included in the interval.</p>
<p>A third option is to use <strong>interval notation</strong>, which is a written abbreviation of the number line.  In this example the interval notation would be</p>
<p>[(0 , 3)]</p>
<p>Notice that this mirrors the number line by having the lowest number on the left, with parenthesis taking the place of the open circles.</p>
<p>Other intervals might include an end point or even extend out toward infinity.  For example, the interval of all numbers greater than or equal to $2$ can be described in any of the following ways</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>set notation</strong>: [\lbrace x\vert-2\leq x&lt;\infty  \rbrace]</li>
<li><strong>number line</strong>: <img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/interval_closed_-2_to_infinity.svg#center" alt=""></li>
<li><strong>interval notation</strong>: [[ -2\thinspace, \thinspace \infty)]</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few subtleties here that deserved to be highlighted.  First, when an endpoint is included, (1) the inequality in set notation includes an equal sign, (2) the circle on the number line is filled in, and (3) the parenthesis in interval notation changes to a square bracket.</p>
<p>Second, to indicate that an interval continues out toward infinity we use an arrow pointing in the appropriate direction.  Since nothing equals infinity we must always use a parenthesis when writing that part of the interval.</p>

<h2 id="combining-intervals">Combining Intervals</h2>
<p>Since intervals are sets of real numbers, they can be combined using unions and intersections.</p>
<p>As before, the union is the all of the two intervals joined together, while the intersection is just where two intervals overlap each other.  A few examples will illustrate the idea.</p>
<p>Suppose we have the following intervals.  What will the <strong>union</strong> look like?  Move the <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> slider to see the union.</p>

<h2 id="order-of-operations">Order of operations</h2>
<p>In elementary school students are often asked to add several numbers together, such as $4 + 10 + 5 = 19$.  What is seldom discussed is the fact that we can't technically add three numbers at once.</p>
<p>Addition, like the other basic operations, is a &quot;binary&quot; operation--it only works on two numbers a time.  To avoid confusion, when multiple operations are needed there is a standard order that should be followed.</p>
<p>The order of operations we use today is sometimes remembered by the acronym P E MD AS, which stands for</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>P</strong>arentheses (including brackets and fraction bars)</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>xponents (including roots)</li>
<li><strong>M</strong>ultiplication and <strong>D</strong>ivision</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>ddition and <strong>S</strong>ubtraction</li>
</ol>
<p>When several of these operations are combined, operations higher on the list should be dealt with before those lower on the list.</p>
<p>If an expression has more than one operation with equal priority (like multiplication and division) then you work with them from left to right.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On a vending machine each button corresponds to a particular snack inside the machine. The item you get depends on the button you push. When you press the button for a soda the machine should dispense that soda, if it is functioning properly.</p>
<p>The linking of each button to only one snack is the idea behind a mathematical function.</p>
<h2 id="the-definition-of-a-function">The Definition of a Function</h2>
<p>While no single formal definition can capture the full extent of the function concept, it is still important to start with a working definition.  The following definition was developed in the early 1900's and is stated in terms of sets.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h4>DEFINITION</h4>
<p>A <strong>function</strong> is any rule that matches each element from one set to exactly one element in another set. The set of inputs is called the <strong>domain</strong> of the function while the <strong>range</strong> is the set of all its output values.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that this definition has three parts: (1) the domain, (2) the range and (3) the rule that links them together.</p>
<p>If $x$ is in the domain and $y$ is in the range, then the function $f$ that links them together could be drawn as a mapping diagram, like the one below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_function_x_y.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="explore-the-concept-of-a-function">Explore the Concept of a Function</h2>
<p>Let's look at a specific example that illustrates the concept.</p>
<p>Suppose three friends went to a deli and each ordered a sandwich, as in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_sandwiches_1.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since each person is linked to just one sandwich, this <em>is</em> a function.  A different arrangement may or may not represent a function.</p>
<p>Anytime we can match each item from one set to just one item another set, then we have created a function.</p>
<p>In the figure below you can change the arrangement of the arrows by moving the <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> points.  Experiment until you feel confident that you can recognize what is and what is not a function.</p>

<h2 id="function-notation">Function Notation</h2>
<p>When there is a function relationship between $x$ and $y$ it is common practice to replace $y$ with $f(x)$ and say that $y=f(x)$.  This is known as <strong>function notation</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_function_x_f_of_x.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>When said aloud the notation $f(x)$ is read &quot;$f$ of  $x$&quot;.  This notation reminds us that the output $f(x)$ is the result of putting the input $x$ inside of the function $f$.</p>
<p>In fact, it can be helpful to think of a function as a machine that changes an object $x$ into something new $f(x)$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/function_machine.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that pressing the button $\text{B4}$ on a vending machine gives you a bag of potato chips. Using function notation we might write $f(\text{B4})=\text{potato chips}$.</p>
<p>The process of determining the output given a particular input is called <strong>evaluating</strong> the function.
<label for="sn-solving" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-solving" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">Evaluating is sometimes confused with solving, which is understandable since they are like two sides of a coin.  <br><br>To <strong>evaluate</strong> we start with an input and find the output.<br><br><strong>Solving</strong> is the reverse process, we are given an output and must find the input.</span></p>
<p>For instance, if our function is $f(x)=x^{2}+6x$, then we evaluate $f(5)$ by replacing every $x$ with $5$:</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
f(5) &amp;= (5)^2+6(5) \newline
&amp;= 25+30 \newline
&amp;= 55
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>A function can be evaluated even if we do not get a numerical result.  Evaluating $f(x^{2})$ or $f(t)$ would mean substituting each $x$ with an $x^{2}$ or with a $t$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="function-notation-and-units">Function Notation and Units</h2>
<p>With function notation the choice of letters is completely arbitrary. For example, if a function always adds $3$ it makes no difference whether we refer to it as $f(x)=x+3$ or as $g(x)=x+3$ or as $w(t)=t+3$. It is what a function does that matters, not what it is called.

<span class="marginnote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/cliff_dive.jpg" alt="Saltos Red Bull en Bilbao 2015"> Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamoral/21713225096/">jamoral, on Flickr</a></span></p>
<p>This is especially helpful when modeling something in real life since we can choose letters that match the context.</p>
<p>For instance, if the height of a professional cliff diver depends on how long it has been since he leapt into the air, then we might use $h$ as the name of the height function and $t$ for the time that has elapsed. The quantity $h(t)$ would then be the height at a particular time $t$.</p>
<p>We should also pay attention to the units of measurement being used. If height is measured in feet and time is in seconds, then it is entirely possible that $2$ <em>seconds</em> after jumping the diver is exactly $2$ <em>feet</em> above the water and we could write $h(2)=2$. Even though the input and output are the same number, when we consider the units we realize they represent very different quantities.</p>

<h2 id="representations-of-functions">Representations of Functions</h2>
<p>Because functions are so widely used, there are many different ways to represent them.  We have already encountered functions represented by mapping diagrams and equations.  We'll also see functions written as tables, sets of points, sequences of operations, and graphs.</p>
<p>Switching from one representation to another can help us see different features and discover connections that might have been hidden otherwise.</p>
<p>Of primary importance will be the connection between a function defined by an equation and its graph.</p>
<h2 id="graphs-of-functions">Graphs of Functions</h2>
<p>The <strong>graph</strong> of a function is the set of all points $(x, y)$ where each $y$ is found by evaluating the function's equation, since $y=f(x)$.</p>
<p>For instance, to graph the function $f(x)=x^{2}-3$ we randomly choose a handful of values for $x$ and evaluate the function for each one, creating a table of values.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$x$</th>
<th>$f(x)=x^{2}-3$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$-2$</td>
<td>$(-2)^2-3 = 1$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$-1$</td>
<td>$(-1)^2-3 =  -2$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$0$</td>
<td>$(0)^2-3 = -3$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$1$</td>
<td>$(1)^2-3 = -2$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$2$</td>
<td>$(2)^2-3 = 1$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$3$</td>
<td>$(3)^2-3 = 6$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Then we convert those values into ordered $(x, y)$ pairs</p>
<p>[
\left\lbrace (-2, 1),  (-1, -2),  (0, -3),  (1, -2),  (2, 1),  (3, 6) \right\rbrace
]</p>
<p>that can be plotted and connected with a smooth curve.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/function_graph_x2-3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Even though calculators and apps can graph most functions, graphing functions by hand is still an important skill to practice.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Sketch a graph of the function $f(x)=\frac{2}{3}x + 1$.<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" /><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/function_graph_2_over_3_x+1.svg#center" alt=""></details></div>
<h2 id="the-vertical-line-test">The Vertical Line Test</h2>
<p>It is important to remember that not every relationship or rule defines a function.  The key is that each input corresponds to just one output.</p>
<p>In order for a graph to be a function each $x$ can only correspond to one $y$.  This means that no two points on the graph can share the same $x$-coordinate.</p>
<p>A quick way to test this is to draw (or imagine drawing) several vertical lines through the graph.  If the graph is a function, then no vertical line will cross the graph more than once.  On the other hand, if any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph is not a function.  For obvious reasons, this test is called the <strong>vertical line test</strong>.</p>
<p>In each of the figures below there is a <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> vertical line.  Apply the vertical line test to each graph by moving the vertical line across the graph.</p>

Rewriting the equation as $y=-1/2 x +2$ we see that each $x$ has exactly one corresponding $y$ value and the graph passes the vertical line test.<br><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/function_graph_VLT_Quick_Check_2.svg#center" alt=""></details></p>

<p>Use a graph to decide if the equation $x^2+y^2=3$ defines $y$ as a function of $x$. <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />No, the graph  of $x^2+y^2=3$ is a circle, which would not pass the vertical line test.
<br><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/function_graph_VLT_Quick_Check_3.svg#center" alt=""><br>
To graph $x^2+y^2=3$ on a calculator you would need to solve for $y$, which results in two equations.  The top half of the circle is $y=\sqrt{3-x^2}$ and the bottom half is $y=-\sqrt{3-x^2}$.  Looking at just one half might lead you to incorrectly assume that the equation is a function.</details></p>

</div>
<h2 id="determining-the-domain-of-a-function">Determining the Domain of a Function</h2>
<p>Every time we identify a function we should also determine its domain.  Recall that the domain is the set of all input values.</p>
<p>If the function is defined by a table, a diagram or a list of points, then we can list every element of the domain explicitly, like we did in the sandwich example earlier.</p>
<p>When a function is defined by an equation we will assume, unless told otherwise, that the domain is every real number input that produces a real number output.</p>
<p>For instance, if $f(x)=\sqrt{x} $ then the domain is any real number greater than or equal to zero, since square roots of negative numbers are not real numbers.  This can be written as an interval $[0,\infty)$ or with set-builder notation $\lbrace x \vert  x \ge 0 \rbrace $.</p>
<p>Similarly, the domain of $g(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ is every real number except zero, since division by zero is undefined.  Writing this as an interval is a bit tricky since we have to use a union:  $(-\infty,0)  \bigcup  (0,\infty)$.  With set-builder notation we simply say which $x$ values cannot be used: $ \lbrace x \vert  x \neq 0 \rbrace $.</p>
<p>As this example shows, it is often easiest to say what is not in the domain.  Specifically, we must always eliminate from the domain any numbers that result in division by zero and even roots of negative numbers.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>
<p>Explain why the domain of $f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2-9}$ is $ \lbrace x \vert x \neq \pm 3 \rbrace $. <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The denominator cannot equal zero, so $x$ cannot be $3$ or $-3$. Using interval notation the domain is $(-\infty,-3) \bigcup (-3, 3) \bigcup (3,\infty)$.  With set-builder notation we can write that a bit more compactly as { $ x  \vert  x\neq \pm 3 $ }.</details></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the domain of $g(x)=\sqrt{x-5}$? <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />To avoid taking the root of a negative number, $x-5&gt;=0$, or $x \geq 5$.  Using interval notation the domain is $[5, \infty)$.  With set builder-notation it is ${x \vert  x \geq 5}$.</details></p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Until we gain familiarity with several different types of functions, it will be difficult to determine the range of a function by inspecting its equation.  We will have more success if we work with the graph of the function instead.</p>
<p>We can learn a lot about a function from looking at its graph.  This will be the focus of the next section.  The overall goal is to categorize functions into families that share similar properties. Once we become familiar with those basic functions and their characteristics, we can begin to choose appropriate functions to model sets of data.</p>

</div>
<br>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>If you've ever ridden a roller coaster you know how it feels to crawl up a hill and rocket down the other side. You also know how your stomach floats at the top and sinks at the bottom. It would be a very boring ride if the track never changed direction. The twists and turns, peaks and valleys make a roller coaster exciting and give it character.</p>
<p>The same can be said for functions: they wouldn't be interesting (or useful) if they didn't change. The way a function changes is often called its &quot;behavior&quot;.</p>
<p>In this section you will learn to recognize function behaviors by looking at a graph, in much the same way that you could pick out the loops and dips of a roller coaster from a photograph.</p>
<h2 id="increasing-decreasing-and-constant">Increasing, Decreasing and Constant</h2>
<p>When we read the shape of a function's graph, we always read from left to right. For instance, a function <strong>increases</strong> if its graph goes up as we move from left to right and <strong>decreases</strong> if it goes down. These behaviors are also referred to as growth and decay, respectively. If the graph is flat then the function is <strong>constant</strong> on that interval; it does not grow or decay.</p>
<p>Consider the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/increasing_decreasing.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This function is increasing on the interval $(a,b)$, constant on $(b,c)$, decreasing over the interval $(c,d)$ and increasing again on $(d,e)$.
<label for="sn-intervals" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-intervals" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">A function is not increasing, decreasing or constant at the endpoints of an interval so we always write those intervals with parenthesis $( \thinspace\thinspace)$, never with brackets $[ \thinspace\thinspace ]$  </span></p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Determine the intervals on which the graph below is increasing, decreasing or constant.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/increasing_decreasing_b.svg#center" alt=""> <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The graph is constant on $(-3, -1)$, increasing on $(-1, 0)$, and decreasing on the interval $(0, 3)$.</details></p>
</div>
<h2 id="maximums-and-minimums">Maximums and Minimums</h2>
<p>Any point where a function changes from increasing to decreasing is known as a <strong>local maximum</strong>.  On a graph it looks something like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/local_max.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>If $f$ has a local maximum at $x=a$, then $f(a)$ is greater than any other function value in its immediate neighborhood, to the left or right.</p>
<p>If it turns out that $f(a)$ is the largest value of the function over its entire domain, then $f(a)$ is called a <strong>global maximum</strong></p>
<p>Likewise, the point where a function changes from decreasing to increasing is called a <strong>local minimum</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/local_min.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>If $f$ has a local minimum at $x=b$, then $f(b)$ is less than any other function values in the immediate neighborhood.</p>
<p>If it happens that $f(b)$ is the lowest value over the entire domain of the function, then $f(b)$ is called a <strong>global minimum</strong>.</p>
<p>Maximum and minimum points are important in many real life applications. For instance, we might want to minimize cost, or maximize fuel efficiency, or minimize waste.</p>
<p>The process of finding exact maximum and minimum values is called <em>optimization</em> and is properly studied in calculus. For our needs, however, a visual inspection of the graph will usually be accurate enough. When more precision is needed, the <code>maximum</code> and <code>minimum</code> commands found on most graphing utilities can be used.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Use the graph below to answer the questions that follow.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/max-min_quick_check.svg#center" alt=""></p>

The value of the global minimum is $f(-3)= -4$.</details></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="intercepts">Intercepts</h2>
<p>In addition to maximum and minimum points, we should also look for points where the graph intersects the axes. The point where the graph crosses the y-axis is called the <strong>y-intercept</strong>.  An <strong>x-intercept</strong> is a point where the graph intersects the x-axis.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/intercepts.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Both of these concepts should be familiar to you from earlier algebra courses. The only new thing to be aware of is that x-intercepts will also be known as <strong>real zeros</strong>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Decide if the following statements are True or False.</p>
<ol>

<p>True or False:  The x-coordinate of a y-intercept is $0$. <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />True.</details></p>

A graph that has multiple y-intercepts, like this example,  <img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/intercepts_quick_check_answer_1.svg" alt=""><br> will not pass the vertical line test and cannot be a function.</details></p>

A function can have many x-intercepts. This function, for instance, has four x-intercepts.  <img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/intercepts_quick_check_answer_2.svg" alt=""></details></p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="asymptotes">Asymptotes</h2>
<p>Sometimes a function increases (or decreases) without bound toward infinity as it approaches a particular $x$ value. When this happens we say the function has a <strong>vertical asymptote</strong> at that $x$ value.  In this example there is a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/vertical_asymptote.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Formally, the vertical line $x=c$ is a vertical asymptote of a function if $f(x)$ approaches either positive or negative infinity as $x$ gets near to $c$,.  This is sometimes written $f(x)\rightarrow\pm \infty$ as $x \rightarrow c$.</p>
<p>We will use dotted vertical lines to indicate vertical asymptotes. Very few graphing utilities will draw asymptotes. You will have to infer their locations from the shape of the graph.</p>
<p>It is also possible for a function to eventually level off to the left or to the right.  When this happens we say the function has a <strong>horizontal asymptote</strong>. In the example below, the function has a horizontal asymptote at $y=3$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horizontal_asymptote.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Technically speaking, the horizontal line $y=k$ is a horizontal asymptote of a function  if $f(x)\rightarrow k$ as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$.</p>
<p>Horizontal asymptotes describe a type of end behavior of a function.  The <strong>end behavior</strong> of a function is how the function changes as $x$ approaches positive infinity or negative infinity. When looking for end behaviors, it doesn't matter how the function behaves in any local neighborhood, it only matters what happens far out at the ends. We will see functions with various combinations of increasing, decreasing and leveling off end behaviors.</p>
<p>Since a function can only have two end behaviors (one as $x \rightarrow \infty$ and another as $x \rightarrow -\infty$), a function can only have, at most, two horizontal asymptotes. There is no such limit on the number of vertical asymptotes.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="concavity">Concavity</h2>
<p>Another important feature of a graph is its curvature, also known as its concavity. If a graph bends up, as if to form the side of a cup, then we say it is <strong>concave up</strong> on that interval. If the graph bends down, like a frown, then it is <strong>concave down</strong>. If the graph is straight then it does not bend and does not have any concavity.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/concavity_simple.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Some graphs change their concavity on different intervals.  A point where a graph switches from being concave up to concave down, or vice versa, is called an <strong>inflection point</strong>.  Locating inflection points exactly is a chore that is best left to calculus, though their locations can be approximated from a detailed graph.</p>
<p>Note that concavity does not tell us if a graph is increasing or decreasing.  Instead, it gives us information about how quickly, or slowly, a function is changing.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/concavity_details.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>For instance, a function that is both increasing and concave down will see its rate of growth slow down.  But the growth rate of an increasing, concave up function will speed up.  Rates of change will be studied in detail <a href="../1.6#rates-of-change">later in this chapter</a>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Identify the intervals where the following graph is concave up and concave down.

At that point the graph changes from being concave down to concave up.  It is concave down on the interval $(-\infty, b)$ and concave up on the interval $(b, \infty)$.<br>
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/concavity_prob_a_answer.png#center" alt="">
At $a$ there is a local maximum and at $c$ a local minimum.  These max/min points have nothing at all to do with concavity.</details></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="complete-graphs">Complete Graphs</h2>
<p>A graph that indicates all the important features of a function is called a <strong>complete graph</strong>.  If a function has any intercepts, asymptotes, maximums and/or minimums, then those should be visible on a complete graph.</p>
<p>Creating a complete graph can be a difficult adventure. Very few, if any, graphing programs will automatically give you a complete graph.  However, they all have commands for zooming in and out and changing the viewing window.</p>
<p>As you learn more about different types of functions, you will be able to reduce the amount of guess work by recognizing how elements of the equation affect the shape of the graph.  For now, however, you will want to experiment with the different zoom and window commands available.</p>
<h2 id="determine-domain-and-range-from-a-graph">Determine Domain and Range from a Graph</h2>
<p>A complete graph can help us identify the domain and range of a function.  Since each point on the graph has an $x$ and a $y=f(x)$ coordinate, the domain and range are the spread of the $x$ and $y$ values, respectively.</p>
<p>For instance, a complete graph of $f(x)=x^{2}-3$ is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/graph_domain_range_x2-3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since the graph continues to expand in the x-direction, its <strong><font color="red">domain</font></strong> is the set of all real numbers $\color{red}{ \lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace  x \text{ is in } \mathbb{R} \rbrace }$ or the interval $\color{red}{(\infty, \infty)}$ or as ausing set-builder notation .  The $\color{blue}{y}$ values start at $\color{blue}{y=-3}$ and continue upward, so the <strong><font color="blue">range</font></strong> is the set $\color{blue}{\lbrace y \thinspace \vert \thinspace y \geq -3 \rbrace}$ or the interval $\color{blue}{[-3, \infty)}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Determine the domain and range of the function shown below.  Assume the graph is a complete graph.

The range is $(-\infty, 5]$, also written as $\lbrace y \thinspace \vert \thinspace y \leq 5 \rbrace$.</details></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Let's look at another example. Suppose the following is a complete graph of a function.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/graph_domain_range_a.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>You might recall that solid dots are always considered part of the graph.  Hollow dots, on the other hand, are used to indicate points that are not part of the graph. Here the <strong><font color="red">domain</font></strong> is the interval $\color{red}{(-2,  2 ]}$ and the <strong><font color="blue">range</font></strong> is $\color{blue}{(-2, 4 ]}$.
<label for="sn-domain_range_1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-domain_range_1" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">In set notation the <strong><font color="red">domain</font></strong> is $\color{red}{ \lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace -2 &lt; x \leq 2 \rbrace }$ and the <strong><font color="blue">range</font></strong> is $\color{blue}{\lbrace y \thinspace \vert \thinspace -2 &lt; y \leq 4 \rbrace}$ </span></p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Determine the domain and range of the function shown below.  Assume the graph is a complete graph.

The range is $[-3, 5]$, or $\lbrace y \thinspace \vert \thinspace -3 \leq y \leq 5 \rbrace$.</details></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If the graph has asymptotes then the domain and range might require the union of several intervals.  In this case, the vertical asymptotes indicate that the values $x=-1$ and $x=1$ are not in the domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/graph_domain_range_f.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The <strong><font color="red">domain</font></strong> is split into three intervals that we union together:  $\color{red}{(-\infty, -1) \bigcup (-1, 1) \bigcup (1, \infty)}$.  The horizontal asymptote  doesn't impact the range, since the center section rises above the asymptote, so our <strong><font color="blue">range</font></strong> is $\color{blue}{(-\infty, 4]}$.</p>
<h2 id="graphs-of-basic-functions">Graphs of Basic Functions</h2>
<p>Every time we encounter a new function we will use its graph to help us identify the domain and range and any other important features, such as intercepts, asymptotes, concavity, etc..  The equation will also be an essential tool, but lots of information can be gleaned from a quick look at the graph.</p>
<p>Below you will be introduced to six basic functions that you should learn by heart.  Use the provided graphs to look for important behaviors.

<h3 id="the-identity-function">The Identity Function</h3>
<p>The identity function $f(x)=x$ is special because the output is always the same as the input, for example $f(5)=5$ or $f(87)=87$.  Its graph is the diagonal line through the origin with a slope of $1$.

<details><summary>Identity Function Properties</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Both the domain and range include all real numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Intercepts:</strong> Since this function crosses at the origin, both the y-intercept and the x-intercept are at the point $(0, 0)$.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing, Decreasing, Constant:</strong> The identity function is increasing over its entire domain.  It is never decreases or becomes constant.</li>
<li><strong>Maximums and Minimums:</strong> There are no maximums or minimums.</li>

<li><strong>Asymptotes:</strong> There are no vertical or horizontal asymptotes.</details><br>
<br></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-square-function">The Square Function</h3>
<p>The square function $f(x)=x^2$ returns the square of every input, for example $f(3)=3^2=9$.  Its graph is a parabola touching the origin.</p>
<p>With negative inputs it is best to include parenthesis like this $f(-2)=(-2)^2=4$ to get the correct values.<br>
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_square.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<details><summary>Square Function Properties</summary>
The graph of the square function is a *parabola*.
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> The domain is all real numbers.  The range is the interval $[0, \infty)$.</li>
<li><strong>Intercepts:</strong> They y-intercept is $y=0$.  The x-intercept is $x=0$.  Both occur at the same point, $(0, 0)$.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing, Decreasing, Constant:</strong> The function is decreasing on $(-\infty, 0)$ and increasing over the interval $(0, \infty)$.  It is not constant anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Maximums and Minimums:</strong> There are no maximums, but there is a global minimum at $(0, 0)$.</li>
<li><strong>Concavity:</strong> The square function is concave up over its entire domain.</li>
<li><strong>Asymptotes:</strong> There are no vertical asymptotes and no horizontal asymptotes.</details><br>

</ul>
<h3 id="the-square-root-function">The Square Root Function</h3>
<p>The principal square root function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ evaluates the square root of non-negative inputs only, it is not defined for negative values.</p>
<p>Most calculators have a dedicated button for computing square roots.  Its graph starts at the origin.
<img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_square_root.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<details><summary>Square Root Function Properties</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> The domain is ${x : x \geq 0 }$.  The range is ${y : y \geq 0 }$.</li>
<li><strong>Intercepts:</strong> Since this function starts at the origin, the y-intercept and the x-intercept are at the same point, $(0, 0)$.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing, Decreasing, Constant:</strong> The function is increasing over its entire domain.  It is never decreasing or constant.</li>
<li><strong>Maximums and Minimums:</strong> There are no maximums, but $(0, 0)$ is a global minimum.</li>
<li><strong>Concavity:</strong> The square root function is concave down over its entire domain.</li>
<li><strong>Asymptotes:</strong> There are no vertical or horizontal asymptotes.</details><br>
<br></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-cube-function">The Cube Function</h3>
<p>The cube function $f(x)=x^3$ produces the cube of any input, which is simply that number multiplied by itself three times.  For instance, $f(2)=2^3=8$ since $2 \times 2 \times 2=8$.</p>
<p>Most calculator do not have a dedicated button for the cube function, instead you must enter something like <strong><code>2^3</code></strong> to cube $2$.

<details><summary>Cube Function Properties</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Both the domain and range include all real numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Intercepts:</strong> This function crosses at the origin, so both the y-intercept and the x-intercept are at the point $(0, 0)$.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing, Decreasing, Constant:</strong> The function is increasing over its entire domain.  It is never decreasing or constant.</li>
<li><strong>Maximums and Minimums:</strong> There are no maximums or minimums.</li>

<li><strong>Asymptotes:</strong> There are no vertical or horizontal asymptotes.</details><br>
<br></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-cube-root-function">The Cube Root Function</h3>
<p>Many calculators have a command somewhere that will evaluate the cube root function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ but it might be hard to find.</p>
<p>It is often easier to use the rule of exponents $\sqrt[3]{x}=x^{1/3}$ to evaluate cube roots.  For example <strong><code>125^(1/3)</code></strong> would give the cube root of $125$.

<li><strong>Asymptotes:</strong> There are no vertical or horizontal asymptotes.</details><br>
<br></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-reciprocal-function">The Reciprocal Function</h3>
<p>The reciprocal function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ takes any number (except $0$) as an input and returns the reciprocal of that number. The easiest way to remember what a reciprocal is, is to see a few examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reciprocal of $\frac{3}{2}$ is $\frac{2}{3}$.</li>
<li>The reciprocal of $5$ is $\frac{1}{5}$.</li>
<li>The reciprocal of $\frac{-6}{7}$ is $\frac{-7}{6}$.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might recall that $\frac{1}{x}=x^{-1}$ is a rule of exponents.  Because of that, many calculators have a button labeled $x^{-1}$ which will compute the reciprocal of a number.

<details><summary>Reciprocal Function Properties</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> The domain is all real numbers except $0$, since division by $0$ is undefined.  The range is also all real numbers except for $0$.</li>
<li><strong>Intercepts:</strong> This function does not have any intercepts.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing, Decreasing, Constant:</strong> The function is increasing on the interval $(-\infty, 0)$ and decreasing on $(0, \infty)$.  It is not constant anywhere.</li>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>These six basic functions form a library that we will use to explore several different topics.  For instance, in <a href="../1.4">Section 1.4</a> you will learn which of these functions can be reversed.  In <a href="../1.5">Section 1.5</a> we discuss how to move their graphs to new locations and alter their shape.  <a href="../1.6">Section 1.6</a> gives numerical methods to distinguish one function from another, so that we don't have to rely entirely on visual identification.  And in <a href="../1.7">Section 1.7</a> you will match patterns in data with the shapes of the basic function in order to create mathematical models.</p>
<p>Since these functions are the building blocks for more complicated ideas, you will be expected to memorize their basic properties.  This <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/Six_Basic_Functions.pdf">downloadable summary</a> will help your study.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Imagine that you flew to Tahiti for a vacation.  After spending some time enjoying the white sandy beaches and crystal clear water, you <em>might</em> want to return home.  To get back home you would need to find a return flight.</p>
<p>In mathematics, a process that brings you back to where you started is called an <strong>inverse</strong>.</p>
<p>In this section you will learn to recognize when a function has an inverse and how to find it.</p>
<h2 id="inverse-operations">Inverse Operations</h2>
<p>Many real life processes have inverses while others do not.  For instance, if you put on your shoes and socks you can easily take them off, but once you boil an egg there's no way to make it raw again.</p>
<p>You are, no doubt, already familiar with some <strong>inverse operations</strong> in mathematics.  Adding and subtracting are inverse operations, for instance.  If you add $6$, and then subtract $6$, you end up right back where you started, having completed a round trip.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_add_6.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Multiplication and division are also inverse operations.  As an example, multiplying by $-3$ and dividing by $-3$ are inverse operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_multiply_neg_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The only exception is $0$.  Multiplying by $0$ cannot be undone with division, since division by $0$ is not well defined.</p>
<p>There are other operations that sometimes have inverses and sometimes do not.  Powers and roots are prime examples. When working with positive numbers, powers and roots are always inverses.  Here are a few powers of $2$ and the corresponding roots, for instance.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_square_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_cube_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_4th_power_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>It gets more complicated when working with negative numbers, however.  Consider the following powers and roots of $ -5$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_square_neg_5.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_cube_neg_5.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_4th_power_neg_5.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This time, taking an even power followed by an even root did not produce a round trip.  This indicates that even powers and roots are not always inverse operations.  Even powers and roots are inverses only when working with non-negative numbers.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the basic inverse operations.</p>

<h2 id="definition-of-an-inverse-function">Definition of an Inverse Function</h2>
<p>If a function has an inverse, then the inverse function should return each output back to its input, just like a return airline flight.  <div class="alert alert-info"></p>
  <h4>DEFINITION</h4>
   The <strong>inverse</strong> of a function $f$ is a function $f^{-1}$ with the property that whenever $f(a)=b$, it always follows that $f^{-1}(b)=a$.
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_function_diagram.svg#center" alt=""></p>
</div>
<p>Note that the outputs of the original function become the inputs of the inverse function.  As a consequence, the domain of $f$ is the range of $f^{-1}$, and the range of $f$ is the domain of $f^{-1}$.</p>
<p>This new notation can be a bit confusing.  The symbol $f^{-1}$ is used to indicate the &quot;inverse of $f $ &quot;.  Even though the $-1$ looks like an exponent it is not:  $f^{-1}$ does <strong>not</strong> mean $\frac{1}{f}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>
<p>Suppose the function $f$ has an inverse and that $f(3)=6$. What do you know about $f^{-1}(6)$?  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />$f^{-1}(6)=3$</details></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose the domain of $f$ is $D= \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4 \rbrace$ and that its range is $R= \lbrace 5, 6, 7, 8 \rbrace$.  What are the domain and range of $f^{-1}$?  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />The domain and range trade places.  The domain of the inverse function is the set $D = \lbrace 5, 6, 7, 8 \rbrace$ and its range is $R = \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4 \rbrace$.</details></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="identify-invertible-functions">Identify Invertible Functions</h2>
<p>Let's look at two functions defined by diagrams and see if they have inverse functions.</p>
<p>This first function matches Jill, Alicia and Mary with their favorite fruit.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_e.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that it is easy to match each fruit back to the person who likes it by reversing the diagram for $f$.  This means that $f$ has an inverse function.</p>
<p>The situation is different with the second function which pairs the same people with their Italian dream car.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_f.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since both Josie and Ahani prefer Ferrari, we are unable to map Ferrari back to a single person.  Thus, according to our definition, $g$ does not have an inverse.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate the general situation.  Functions only have inverses if each output comes from just one input.  In other words, different inputs always generate different outputs.  The only way for $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ is for $x_1 = x_2$.  Functions with this property are called <strong>one-to-one</strong> functions.  Only one-to-one functions have inverses.</p>
<p>When a function is defined by a diagram, you can determine if it is one-to-one by inspecting each input-output pair.  If two or more different inputs are paired with the same output, then the function is not one-to-one and does not have an inverse.  This technique can also be used when the function is defined by a table or a list of points.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

</div>
<h2 id="the-horizontal-line-test">The Horizontal Line Test</h2>
<p>Since different inputs to a one-to-one function always create different outputs, no two points on the graph of a one-to-one function can have the same y-coordinate.</p>
<p>A quick way to test this is to draw (or imagine drawing) several horizontal lines through the graph.  If the function is one-to-one, then no horizontal line will cross the graph more than once.  This test is called the <strong>horizontal line test</strong> and works exactly like the vertical line test, except in the horizontal direction.

<h2 id="graph-the-inverse-of-a-function">Graph the Inverse of a Function</h2>
<p>This idea of reversing the ordered pairs to find the inverse can be used to graph inverse functions, even if we don't know their equations.  We can do this by identifying a point $(\color{red}{x}, \color{blue}{y})$ on the graph of $f$ and reversing the coordinates.  The new point $(\color{blue}{y}, \color{red}{x})$ will be on the graph of $f^{-1}$.</p>
<p>Use the interactive figure below to explore this relationship.  As you move the blue point $\color{blue}{(x, y)}$ on $f$ the inverse point $\color{black}{(y, x)}$ on $f^{-1}$ will be plotted.</p>

<p>As you might have noticed, reversing the ordered pairs has the same effect as reflecting the graph across the line $y=x$.  In fact, a quick way to graph an inverse by hand is to locate a few points on the graph of $f$ and reflect them.</p>
<h2 id="find-inverses-of-basic-functions">Find Inverses of Basic Functions</h2>
<p>When a function is defined by a single operation, finding the inverse is as simple as finding the inverse operation, if it exists.</p>
<h3 id="cube--cube-root">Cube &amp; Cube Root</h3>
<p>For instance, since the cube and cube root are opposite operations, the cube and cube root functions are inverses of each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_cube.svg#center" alt=""> <img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_cube_root.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that both functions pass the horizontal line test.</p>
<h3 id="square--square-root">Square &amp; Square Root</h3>
<p>The square function, on the other hand, does not pass the horizontal line test, so it cannot have an inverse.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/library_square.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>At the same time, it certainly would be useful to think of the square and square root functions as inverses.  Perhaps there is a way to work around this?</p>
<p>The solution is to remember that the square and square root are inverse operations only when working with non-negative numbers.  If we restrict the domain and only work with $f(x)=x^{2}$ when $x \geq 0$, then we will have a pair of inverse functions.</p>

<h2 id="use-the-shoes-and-socks-method-to-find-inverses">Use the Shoes and Socks Method to Find Inverses</h2>
<p>You have learned that if a one-to-one function is defined by a diagram, table, or graph, then its inverse can be found by reversing the ordered pairs.  If the function is defined by a single operation, then the inverse is the function that performs the opposite operation.</p>
<p>When functions are composed of several operations, there are two methods for finding the inverse, if it exists.  In <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/chapter-4/4.4#learn-the-switch-and-solve-method">Chapter 4</a> you will learn a <strong>switch and solve</strong> method based on the idea of reversing the ordered pairs of a function.</p>
<p>Right now, however, the focus will be on a simpler <strong>socks and shoes</strong> method.  This method gets its name from the obvious place.  When getting dressed you put on your socks before putting on your shoes.  To take them off you must reverse the order:  first remove your shoes and then take off your socks.</p>
<p>A great illustration of this method comes from the classic television program <em>Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood</em>.
<label for="mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕

<input type="checkbox" id="mn-" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="marginnote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/Mr-Rogers-stamp.jpg" alt=""> The U.S. Postal Service honored Fred Rogers (1928–2003) with a Forever stamp on the 50th anniversary of <em>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</em> in March, 2018.</span>
At the start of each episode, the late Fred Rogers would walk in singing the song &quot;Won't You Be My Neighbor?&quot;  As he sang he would</p>
<ol>
<li>Take off his jacket</li>
<li>Put on a sweater</li>

<li>Take off the sneakers</li>

<li>Take off the sweater</li>
<li>Put on his jacket</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the two lists contain the inverse actions in the reverse order.  That is the key!  If we can identify the order in which a function performs its operations, we should be able to construct its inverse by doing the inverse operations in the reverse order.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the function $f(x)=3x-2$.  Following the standard order of operations, this function first multiplies each input by $3$ and then subtracts $2$.</p>
<p>The inverse function must do the inverse operations in the reverse order: add $2$ and then divide by $3$.</p>
<p>Now that we have identified the operations that the inverse should do, we construct the equation for $f^{-1}$ by applying each of those operations, in the order listed, to a variable.  The steps are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>1.</th>
<th>Start with a variable</th>
<th>$x$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Add $2$</td>
<td>$$x+2$$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Divide by $3$</td>
<td>$$\frac{x+2}{3}$$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>Write as a function</td>
<td>$$f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x+2}{3}$$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We should also check that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ have the round trip property we have seen earlier.  To do this pick any random number, see where $f$ takes that number, and then check to see if $f^{-1}$ will bring it back.  For instance, if $x=7$ then $f(\color{red}{7})=\color{blue}{19}$ and $f^{1}(\color{blue}{19})=\color{red}{7}$</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_equation_a.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>so the round trip property appears to hold.  It would be good to test this with a few more random values just to make sure.  In <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/chapter-4/4.4#verify-inverse-functions">Chapter 4</a> we will discuss a way to formally verify that it works for any number.</p>

<p>Now let's use the shoes-and-socks method to find the inverse of $f(x) = 2x^3 + 4$.  We begin by identifying the operations performed by the function, and then invert the list to find the operations of the inverse function.</p>

<p>Let's look at one last example of the shoes-socks method and find the inverse of $f(x) = (x+1)^2$.  We'll list the operations performed by the function and then list what the inverse function should do, just as we have done earlier.</p>

<p>But when we check the round trip property we see that some values, such as $x=-5$, don't work.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/inverse_equation_c.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This is because we have made a critical oversight.  A <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/graph_(x+1)2.png">graph</a> of $f(x) = (x+1)^2$ shows that it is <em>not</em> a one-to-one function, so it cannot have an inverse unless we <strong>restrict the domain</strong>.  To do this we require the input of the square to be greater than or equal to zero.  In this case, we need $x+1 \geq 0$, which is the same thing as saying $x \geq -1$.  Only when we restrict domain of $f(x)=(x+1)^2$ to $x \geq -1$ will the two functions will be inverses.  We will have to keep an eye out for this any time a function, or its potential inverse, includes an even power.</p>
<h2 id="interpreting-inverse-functions">Interpreting Inverse Functions</h2>
<p>Earlier in this section we found that the domain and range of $f$ become the range and domain, respectively, of the inverse function $f^{-1}$.  Not only do the domain and range trade places, but their units of measure do as well.  Keeping track of those units makes it much easier to understand the significance of an inverse function.</p>
<p>For instance, the amount of time $T$ that it takes you to drive to work in minutes is a function of how fast you drive in miles per hour.  In theory, if you know your average speed $S$, then you can predict how long the trip will take.</p>
<p>The inverse function, if it exists, would turn speed into a function that depends on the time.  With the inverse function, knowing the duration of the trip allows you to calculate the average speed. Symbolically, if $T=f(S)$, then $S=f^{-1}(T)$.</p>
<p>With this understanding, the distinction between $f(45)$ and $f^{-1}(45)$ is much more clear.  In this example, $f(45)$ would be the time it takes to drive to work if the average speed is $45$ mph.  On the other hand, $f^{-1}(45)$ would be the speed required so that the trip takes $45$ minutes.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In this section we have see how to identify when a function has an inverse and discussed techniques for finding and interpreting the inverse.  We have also hinted at the fact that an equation only has a unique solution if the underlying function is one-to-one.</p>
<p>Every time we encounter a new function in the following chapters, we will want to determine if it is one-to-one or not.  If it is, then we will also look for its inverse.  If not, then we will consider restricting its domain and focusing on a smaller piece of the function that does have an inverse.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When making ice cream, chefs often start with a basic recipe and then add in different amounts of special ingredients, like macadamia nuts or dark chocolate or berries. Experienced chefs know the effect that each addition will have before they even taste the finished product.</p>
<p>In a very similar way, we can take basic functions and transform them into new functions by adding constants into the mix.  As you gain experience you will be able to predict the behavior of a function without graphing it.  You will also learn to construct the equation for a function given its graph.</p>
<p>Given a generic function $f$ and any constant number $\color{blue}{c}$, there are four ways to combine them to form a new function.  We could</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>1.</th>
<th>Add $\color{blue}{c}$ to the function value $f(x)$.</th>
<th>$f(x)+\color{blue}{c}$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Add $\color{blue}{c}$ to the input value $x$.</td>
<td>$f(x+\color{blue}{c})$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Multiply $f(x)$ by $\color{blue}{c}$.</td>
<td>$\color{blue}{c} \thinspace  f(x)$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>Multiply $x$ by $\color{blue}{c}$.</td>
<td>$f(\color{blue}{c} \thinspace x)$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We will use interactive figures to explore each of these combinations.  Pay special attention to how both the graph and the equation change as you apply the transformation.  It may even help to keep track of one or two points and compare their locations before and after the transformation.</p>
<h2 id="vertical-shifts">Vertical Shifts</h2>
<p>The first transformation we want to look at is adding a constant $\color{blue}{c}$ to the output of the function, $f(x)$.</p>
<p>In this figure you can change the value of $\color{blue}{c}$. The graph of the original function $\color{black}{f(x)}$ is shown in $\color{black}{black}$.  The transformed function $\color{red}{f(x)}  \color{blue}{+ c}$ will be shown in $\color{red}{red}$.</p>
<p>How would you describe the relationship between the two graphs?</p>

<p>The result of adding a constant to a function is that the graph moves up or down $\color{blue}{c}$ spaces.</p>
<p>More formally, if $\color{red}{f}$ is any function and $\color{blue}{c}$ is any constant, then the graph $\color{red}{f(x)}  \color{blue}{+ c}$ is a <strong>vertical shift</strong> of the function $f$.  The graph of $\color{red}{f(x)}  \color{blue}{+ c}$ can be found by adding $\color{blue}{c}$ to every y-value of the original graph.  We can summarize this by saying</p>
<ul>
<li>If $\color{blue}{c&gt;0}$, then $\color{red}{f(x)} \color{blue}{+ c}$ is found by shifting the graph of $f$ up $\color{blue}{c}$ spaces.</li>

You have just seen that the graph of $\color{red}{f(x } \color{blue}{+ c}\color{red}{)}$ is a <strong>horizontal shift</strong> of the function $f$.  The graph of $\color{red}{f(x } \color{blue}{+ c}\color{red}{)}$  can be found by subtracting $\color{blue}{c}$ from every x-value of the original graph.  In other words,
<ul>
<li>If $\color{blue}{c&gt;0}$, then $\color{red}{f(x} \color{blue}{+ c}\color{red}{)}$ is found by shifting $f$ to the left $\color{blue}{c}$ spaces.</li>
<li>If $\color{blue}{c&lt;0}$, then $\color{red}{f(x } \color{blue}{+ c}\color{red}{)}$ is found by shifting $f$ to the right $\color{blue}{c}$ spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Horizontal shifts are somewhat counter intuitive, and you will want to refer back to this chart often as you work through the exercises.</p>
<p>Vertical and horizontal shifts do not change the shape of the graph, only its location.  Our next few transformations, however, will alter the shape of the graph.</p>

<p>In other words, if $\color{red}{f}$ is any function and $\color{blue}{c}$ is any constant, then the graph of  $\color{blue}{c}\color{red}{ f(x)}$ is a <strong>vertical stretch</strong> of the original function $\color{red}{f}$. The graph of $\color{blue}{c}\color{red}{ f(x)}$ can be found by multiplying each y-value of the original graph by $\color{blue}{c}$.</p>
<p>If $\color{blue}{0&lt;c&lt;1}$, then the graph $\color{blue}{c}\color{red}{f(x)}$ is sometimes called a vertical <em>compression</em> of the graph of $\color{red}{f}$.  We will use the word stretch for both situations, with the understanding that the graph is always scaled by a factor of $\color{blue}{c}$.</p>

This <strong>horizontal stretch</strong> is one of the most counter-intuitive transformations you will encounter.  You should have seen that the graph got wider when $\color{blue}{c}$ was small, and narrower when $\color{blue}{c}$ was large.
<p>When we encounter a transformation of the form $\color{red}{f (} \color{blue}{c}\thinspace \color{red}{x)}$,  its graph can be found by dividing each x-value of the original graph by $\color{blue}{c}$.</p>
<ul>
<li>If $\color{blue}{c&gt;1}$, then the resulting graph is <em>compressed</em> horizontally.</li>
<li>If $\color{blue}{0&lt;c&lt;1}$, then the resulting graph is <em>stretched</em> horizontally.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, the x-values are always scaled by a factor of $\color{blue}{1/c}$.</p>

<p>Notice that the location of the constant indicates whether the transformation is vertical or horizontal.  Changes <em>outside</em> the function alter the y-coordinate and result in vertical transformations, while changes <em>inside</em> the function impact the x-coordinate and cause horizontal transformations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can determine if the transformation is a shift or a stretch by looking at the operation. Shifts are addition, stretches are multiplication.  Horizontal transformations always behave in a counter intuitive way, so you will want to be extra careful with them.</p>

<h2 id="even-and-odd-symmetry">Even and Odd Symmetry</h2>
<p>When reflecting a graph, two interesting things happen sometimes.  The first is that a horizontal reflection across the y-axis might  produces the same exact graph as the original function.  Symbolically, $f(-x)=f(x)$.  When this happens we say that the function has <strong>even symmetry</strong>, or is symmetric across the y-axis.   The figure below illustrates the concept.</p>

<p>The other interesting thing that can happen with reflections is that a horizontal reflection and a vertical reflection might have the same result, that is $f(-x)=-f(x)$.  When this happens the function has <strong>odd symmetry</strong> and is symmetric around the origin.  Visually, a 180-degree rotation around the origin produces the same exact image.  This is illustrated in the following interactive figure.</p>

<h2 id="verifying-symmetry-algebraically">Verifying Symmetry Algebraically</h2>
<p>While visual identification of symmetry is quick and easy, our eyes can sometimes be deceived.  If a function is defined by an equation, then it is best to verify symmetry algebraically.  If a function is even, then we should be able to demonstrate that the equations for $f(-x)$ and $f(x)$ are the same.  If has odd symmetry, then the equations for $f(-x)$ and $-f(x)$ should be identical.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/symmetry_check_algebraic.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Consider the graph of $f(x)=x^3+0.01$, which appears to have odd symmetry.  Checking the equations we find that</p>
<p>[
f(-x) = (-x)^3+0.01 = -x^3+0.01
]</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>[
-f(x) = -(x^3+0.01) = -x^3-0.01
]</p>
<p>Since the two equations are not the same,  $f(x)=x^3+0.01$ does not have odd symmetry.</p>
<p>A second look at the equation explains why this is the case.  Notice that $f(x)=x^3+0.01$ is nothing more than the cube function shifted $0.01$ units up.  It's graph</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/symmetry_check_algebraic_graph.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>does not go through the origin, rather it has a y-intercept at $(0, 0.01)$.  It is this small shift that causes the function to loose its odd symmetry.</p>
<p>Let's look at one more example.  The graph of $f(x)=x^{2}+1$ looks like it has even symmetry.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/symmetry_check_algebraic_graph_2.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>To check this algebraically, we need to compare the equation for $f(-x)$ with the equation for $f(x)$.  If the two match, then it really does have even symmetry.  Otherwise, it does not.</p>
<p>Replacing $x$ with $-x$ we find that</p>
<p>[
f(-x) = (-x)^2-1 = x^{2}-1
]</p>
<p>which is exactly the same equation as $f(x)$.  Since $f(-x)=f(x)$, we can confidently conclude that $f(x)=x^{2}+1$ has even symmetry.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Transformations will be helpful when we model data in <a href="../1.7">Section 1.7</a>.  If a data set looks like a line, for example, then we can apply shifts and stretches to the identity function $f(x)=x$ until we find a combination that fits the shape of the data.</p>
<p>In future chapters, we will find transformations included in the standard forms of several function models.  Being able to predict the effects of a shift or stretch will often simplify calculations and may give insight into easier techniques for solving equations.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When the stock market opened on Monday, October 22, 2001, stock in Enron (a Fortune-500 energy company) was trading for about $20 per share.</p>
<p>At the same time stock in Apple (the electronics manufacturer) could be also be purchased for $20.</p>
<p>Without additional information, it would be natural to assume that state of both companies was the same.  In reality, however, they were headed in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Later that same day Enron announced they were being investigated for accounting irregularities.  Within weeks the company declared bankruptcy and several Enron executives were sent to prison for fraud and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, had an important announcement of their own.  The next day, on October 23, 2001, Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the very first iPod.  It was an iconic success that revolutionized the consumer electronics industry and helped establish Apple as one of the most innovative technology companies in the world.</p>
<h2 id="rates-of-change">Rates of Change</h2>
<p>Just like stocks, functions can increase and decrease in value.  In an <a href="../1.3#concavity">earlier section</a> we saw that graphs can be concave up, concave down, or even straight.  This is an indication that functions can change at different rates, or speeds.</p>
<p>For instance, an increasing function could grow at a steady rate, at a rate that quickens, or at a rate that slows.  All three options are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/increasing_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Functions can also decrease at constant, increasing, and decreasing rates.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/decreasing_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Our goal now is to develop tools that allow us to measure, compare and categorize functions based on their rates of change.</p>

<span class="sidenote">The upper-case Greek leter delta ($\Delta$) is used throughout math and science to indicate change.</span></p>
<p>To calculate the total change of a function on some interval $[a, b]$ we find the difference between the starting value $f(a)$ and the ending value $f(b)$.</p>

<h2 id="percentage-change">Percentage Change</h2>
<p>The <strong>percentage change</strong> of a function $f$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is the ratio of the total change to the starting value.  We calculate percentage change as follows:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>percentage change = $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{f(a)}$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>With this formula the percentage change is given in decimal form.  In other words, a value such as $0.12$ should be interpreted as $12\%$.  Also note that the percentage change cannot be computed if $f(a)=0$.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="average-rate-of-change">Average Rate of Change</h2>
<p>The concepts of total change and percentage change are more useful when we average them across the length of the interval.  The resulting quantities describe per unit changes.  That is to say, by averaging we can tell what will happen to $f(x)$ every time $x$ increases by $1$.</p>
<p>You are probably already familiar with the basic process of finding averages.  For instance, if you drove a distance of 100 miles in 2 hours then your average speed would be $\frac{100 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}$.</p>
<p>Your actual speed may have gone up and down during the trip but, on average, your speed was 50 miles per hour.</p>
<p>To find the average change of a function we follow the same process and divide the total change of the function $\Delta y$ by the corresponding change $\Delta x$ in the input values to get $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$.</p>
<p>Since $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is a ratio, it is often called the <strong>average <em>rate</em> of change</strong> of a function.</p>
<p>To compute the average rate of change of a function $f$ over the interval $[a, b]$ we use the formula</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>[ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}  = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}]</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>To see how this works let's find the average rate of change of $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ on the interval $[9, 100]$.  Using the formula above we see that</p>
<p>[ \begin{align}
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{100} - \sqrt{9}} {100 - 9} \newline
&amp;= \frac{10-3}{91} \newline
&amp;= \frac{7}{91} \newline
&amp;\approx 0.077
\end{align}]</p>
<p>This means that from $x=9$ to $x=100$ the function $f(x)=\sqrt x$ increases, on average, by $0.077$ every time $x$ increases by $1$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Calculate the average rate of change of $f(x)=\sqrt x$ over the interval $[0,16]$.  <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />[ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{0}}{16-0}=\frac{4-0}{16}=\frac{1}{4}]</details></div>
<p>The average rate of change formula might look familiar.  That's because it is the same thing as the <em>slope</em> of the line connecting the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.  This line is called a secant line.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/secant.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>When a function is defined by a graph, the average rate of change can always be found by calculating the slope of the secant line.</p>

<h2 id="patterns-of-change">Patterns of Change</h2>
<p>We can gain additional insight into the behavior of a function by looking for patterns of change.  One way to do this is to compute the total change of the function over several successive intervals that all have the same length.  In other words, when the input values are equally spaced, we will look for a pattern in the output values.  Typically we choose the length as $\Delta x = 1$, so that all the input values are $1$ unit apart, but any even spacing will work.</p>
<p>Suppose $f(x)=3x+2$.  Let's calculate the total change on number of intervals where $\Delta x=1$.  For simplicity, we will refer to these collectively as the <strong>first differences</strong> of the function. and see if some pattern emerges.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_1.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that the first differences are constant.  This will happen anytime the function is linear.</p>
<p>Let's go a bit further, and look at first differences for $f(x)=x^{2}$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_2a.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The first differences are not constant, which tells us that $f(x)=x^{2}$ is not a linear function.  But why stop with first differences?  The <strong>second differences</strong> are the differences between the first differences.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Here the second differences are constant.  The second differences of quadratic functions are always constant.</p>
<p>Based on these results, you might expect that the <strong>third differences</strong> of a cubic function will be constant.  And you would be right.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The temptation, however, is to assume that the differences will always be constant at some point, no matter which function we choose.  That would be a mistake, as the next example will illustrate.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_4.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>While there is a clear pattern, the differences never become constant.  Perhaps, what we should really look at with this function are the <em>percent</em> changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/percent_change_1.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Functions like this one, where the percentage change is constant, are called exponential functions, and we study them in <a href="//chapter-3/3.1">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

Since the second differences are constant, $g$ is a quadratic function.</details>
</div>
<p>First and second differences also provide us a way to identify when it is increasing or decreasing and its concavity.</p>

<p>With this in mind, let's take another look at the first and second differences for the cube $f(x) = x^3$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/finite_differences_5.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that the first differences are all positive, suggesting that $f(x) = x^3$ is always increasing.  And since the second differences switch from negative to positive at $0$, we conclude that the function is concave down to the left of $0$ and concave up to the right of $0$.  We came to the same conclusions after a visual inspection in <a href="../1.3#the-cube-function">Section 1.3</a>, but now we have numerical evidence as well.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>What do the first and second differences of the square function $f(x)=x^{2}$ tell you about its behavior?

<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Since the first differences switch from negative to positive at $0$, we can conclude that the square function decreases to the left of $0$ and increases to the right of $0$.  And since the second differences are always positive, the square function must be concave up over its entire domain.</details>
</div>
<h2 id="difference-quotients">Difference Quotients</h2>
<p>The formulas and tables we have used so far can only show what happens on a limited number of intervals.  What would be very helpful is a mechanism that has the potential to describing the behavior of the function on any interval all at once.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient.svg#center" alt="">
The tool that does this is called the <strong>difference quotient</strong>.  The difference quotient $D(x)$ is a function that lets us calculate the average rate of change on a generic interval from $x$ to  $\color{blue}{x+h}$, where  $\color{blue}{h}$  is any positive number.  To find the formula for the difference quotient we simply take the average rate of change formula</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/average_change.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>and substitute $x$ in place of  $a$, and $\color{blue}{x+h}$  in place of  $\color{blue}{b}$.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
\frac{f(\color{blue}{b})-f(\color{red}{a})}{\color{blue}{b}-\color{red}{a}} &amp;= \frac{f(\color{blue}{x+h})-f(\color{red}{x})}{\color{blue}{(x+h)}-\color{red}{x}} \newline \newline
&amp;= \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>The behavior of $D(x)$ will help us understand how $f(x)$ changes.  For instance, the value of $D(x)$ indicates whether the function is increasing, decreasing or constant.</p>
<ul>
<li>If $D(x)&gt;0$, then $f(x)$ in increasing.</li>
<li>If $D(x)&lt;0$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing.</li>
<li>If $D(x)=0$, then $f(x)$ is constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the way $D(x)$ changes tells us the concavity of the function.  Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>If $D(x)$ is increasing, then $f(x)$ is concave up.</li>
<li>If $D(x)$ is decreasing, then $f(x)$ is concave down.</li>
<li>If $D(x)$ is constant, then $f(x)$ is a straight line and $D(x)$ is the slope.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, let's see what the difference quotient has to say about $f(x)=3x+2$, which is an increasing linear function with a slope of $3$.  Hopefully the difference quotient will say the same thing.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient_3x+2.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since $D(x)=3$ is always positive, we know that $f(x)$ is increasing over its entire domain.  And the fact that $D(x)$ is constant confirms what we already knew, that $f(x)$ is a straight line with a slope of $3$.</p>
<p>Let's now look at the difference quotient for $f(x)=x^{2}$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient_x_squared.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that no matter what value $h$ happens to be, $D(x)$ is an increasing linear function, so $f(x)$ is concave up over its entire domain.  When $D(x)&gt;0$, $f(x)=x^{2}$ will be increasing, and when $D(x)&lt;0$, $f(x)=x^{2}$ is decreasing.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>We have just seen that the difference quotient helps us identify function behaviors such as concavity and intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing.  As we introduce new functions in the next chapters, you will that functions with similar behaviors have similar difference quotients.</p>
<p>We will also use the difference quotient to efficiently compute <em>average</em> rates of change. Additionally, if you continue on to calculus, you will find that the difference quotient is used to calculate <em>instantaneous</em> rates change and is the foundation of the <strong>derivative</strong>, one of the most important concepts in calculus.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Every spring, hundreds of people come to the Great Plains region of the United States in an attempt to get as close as possible to one of nature's most violent events:  a tornado.  While some go to &quot;Tornado Alley&quot; just for the thrill, most professional storm chasers have a different goal.  What they want is data: scientific measurements that can only be found inside real tornadoes.</p>
<p>Scientists and university researchers, like those at NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory, hope to use that data to create mathematical models that will help them understand the inner workings of tornadoes and how they form.</p>
<h2 id="understand-the-modeling-process">Understand the Modeling Process</h2>
<p>When we speak of a <strong>mathematical model</strong>, what exactly are we talking about?  A model is simplified representation of a real world object.  It often takes the form of a table of values, a graph, or an equation.  Mathematical models are found in nearly every field of study and are useful when it is not feasible, economical, practical, or safe to work with the real item.</p>
<p>Once a model has been created, we can use the rules of mathematics to discover things about its mathematical behavior. Those discoveries can, in turn, can be used to make predictions and give insight about how the real world object might behave.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/modeling_diagram.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Further observations and adjustments help the model look more like how the real world looks.</p>
<h2 id="scatterplots">Scatterplots</h2>
<p>Many physical laws, like the law of gravity, were discovered by gathering data and looking for patterns.  One of our primary tools for visualizing data is the <strong>scatterplot</strong>.  A scatterplot is nothing more than pairs of data plotted as points on a grid.</p>
<p>For example, researchers from Purdue University analyzed 1285 tornadoes in Indiana from 1950 to 2012.

One set of data compared the number of tornadoes observed at different hours of the day.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/tornado_time.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The scatterplot shows a clear pattern in the data and suggests that most tornadoes form late in the afternoon.  This is a well known result that follows from the fact that by mid afternoon the sun has heated the ground and the atmosphere enough to produce thunderstorms.</p>
<p>The red curve is a model of the data and could be used to make predictions.</p>
<h2 id="interpolation-and-extrapolation">Interpolation and Extrapolation</h2>
<p>Models can be used to make estimations in two different ways. Making a prediction outside of a data set is called <strong>extrapolation</strong>.  Estimating a value that is in between known values is <strong>interpolation</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if we knew the number of tornadoes in 1900 and in 2000, then predicting how many will happen in 2050 would be an extrapolation, since that value lies outside of the known data.  Extrapolation assumes that an existing trend will continue unchanged into the future, which is never guaranteed.</p>
<p>Estimating the number of tornadoes in the year 1950, however, would be interpolation, since 1950 is between the known values.</p>

<h2 id="modeling-with-transformations">Modeling with Transformations</h2>
<p>If we find that a set of data has a shape similar to one of our basic functions, then transformations can be used to shift and stretch that function to make it model the data.  Let's look at a few transformed functions that you might have seen in prior algebra classes.</p>
<h3 id="slope-intercept-form-of-a-line">Slope-Intercept Form of a Line</h3>
<p>To begin, we take the identity function $f(x)=x$ and stretch it vertically by a factor of $\color{blue}{m}$ and shift it vertically $\color{green}{b}$ units.  The result, $y=\color{blue}{m}x+\color{green}{b}$, is known as the <strong>slope-intercept</strong> form for a line, where $\color{blue}{m}$ is the slope and $\color{green}{b}$ is the y-intercept.  The figure below will let you experiment with this equation.</p>

<h3 id="point-slope-form-of-a-line">Point-Slope Form of a Line</h3>
<p>Another transformed version of the identity function is $y=\color{blue}{m}(x-\color{brown}{x_1})+\color{green}{y_1}$.</p>
<p>This new equation applies a shift right $\color{brown}{x_1}$ spaces, a vertical stretch by $\color{blue}{m}$, and a vertical shift $\color{green}{y_1}$ spaces.</p>
<p>The result is a line that passes through the point $(\color{brown}{x_1}, \color{green}{y_1})$ and has a slope of $\color{blue}{m}$.  We call this the <strong>point-slope</strong> form of a line.  You can experiment with this equation in the figure below.</p>

<h3 id="another-tornado-data-set">Another Tornado Data Set</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at another set of data about tornadoes.  Here we are given the percentage of tornadoes touching down within several kilometers of populated areas.</p>

<p>This scatterplot reveals a strong linear trend with the percentage of observed tornadoes increasing further away from the city or town center, with the equation $y=\color{blue}{2.84}x+\color{green}{0.14}$ being a good model for the data.</p>
<p>If we use our model to extrapolate back to a distance of $0$ kilometers it seems that there is $0\%$ chance of seeing a tornado, which might suggest that people in cities are safer than those in rural areas.  But since cities cover a small fraction of the land in any state, the opposite may actually be true.</p>
<p>Other research suggests that the slower wind and hotter air in urban areas can actually increase the tornado-genesis process.  Tornadoes are certainly not diverted by any structure or building.  They have been know to hit large cities, pass over rivers, climb hills and cross canyons.  <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#Safety" title="NOAA's tornado safety guidelines">The safest place is in a fortified tornado shelter.</a></p>
<p>The lesson here is that even when the data has an obvious pattern, we must be careful and take time to find and consider other underlying factors before we make predictions or conclusions from our model.</p>
<h2 id="aligning--scaling-data">Aligning &amp; Scaling Data</h2>
<p>When making a scatterplot we must decide which quantity will be represented by the independent variable and which is the dependent variable.  It may also be helpful to align and/or scale the data.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how this works, we will use the following raw data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to create a scatterplot.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/apple_data_raw.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>With this data, it seems reasonable that the year is independent and the price is dependent.  Since we don't want a graph that is 2009 units wide, we choose to <strong>align</strong> the years by converting them to years since 2000.  This is done by subtracting 2000 from each year.</p>
<p>And we might want to convert the price to <em>dollars</em> per pound rather than <em>cents</em> per pound.  To change the <strong>scale</strong> of the prices we divide each price by 100.  The result of aligning the years and scaling the prices is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/apple_data_aligned.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Now that we have aligned and scaled the apple data, let's take a look at the scatterplot and compare its shape with the shapes of the six basic functions that we know.  Does it look like the identity function or the square function? Perhaps it looks like the reciprocal or the cube root function?</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/apple_data_graph.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since this data appears linear, we should be able to model it with a transformed version of the identity function $f(x)=x$.  Specifically, we will use the slope-intercept form of a line $y = \color{blue}{m} x + \color{green}{b}$.</p>
<p>All that remains is to find values of $\color{red}{m}$ and $\color{green}{b}$ that make the model fit the data as closely as possible.</p>
<p>In the figure below, you are free to change both the slope $\color{red}{m}$ and the y-intercept $\color{green}{b}$ until you find a line that fits the data.  Make a note of your equation before continuing.</p>

<p>You may have had trouble finding just one line that fit well.  In fact, good arguments could be made for several lines.  However, the line that is as close as possible to each point is the line $\color{blue}{y} = \color{red}{0.04}x + \color{green}{0.86}$.</p>
<p>Where did this equation come from and how do we know it is the best?  Well, that's a great question would take a few weeks in a statistics course to explain fully.  For now, it's enough to know that most graphing calculators have a built-in programs that fit equations to data.  That process is called <em>least squares regression</em>, and we will look at it later in this section.</p>
<h2 id="construct-models">Construct Models</h2>
<p>Now that we have an equation, $\color{blue}{y} = \color{red}{0.04}x + \color{green}{0.86}$, it's time to turn that into an actual model.</p>
<p>Throughout this text, a model will consist of a function along with a description of its the variables and their units of measure.  Without an accurate description, the function itself is meaningless since there would be no way to relate it to the real world.</p>
<p>Since our independent variable is time in years since 2000, we take the liberty of using $t$ in place of $\color{blue}{x}$.</p>
<p>Similarly, using $p$ instead of $\color{blue}{y}$ will help us remember that the dependent variable represents the price of apples.  We are now ready to write our model.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to data provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the price $p$ of apples per pound can be modeled by the function
[ p(t) = 0.04t + 0.86 ]
where $t$ is the time in years since 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This model could be used to predict the price of a pound of apples in the year 2030.  To do this we simply evaluate the function for $t=30$ (remember, $t$ is years <em>since</em> 2000.)</p>
<p>[
p(30) = 0.04(30) + 0.86 = 2.06
]</p>
<p>Thus, our model predicts the average price of apples will be $2.06 in the year 2030.  How accurate is that?  We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>We now turn our attention to another scenario.  Throughout the grasslands of Nevada live herds of wild horses known as &quot;mustangs&quot;.  Since 1971, the Bureau of Land Management has been monitoring the number of mustangs and the land's capacity to support them.  When the number of horses exceeds an appropriate management level, the BLM gathers animals from overpopulated herds and makes them available for adoption.</p>
<p>Every year the BLM conducts aerial surveys in an effort to count each horse.  A functional model of that data can be used to predict the future size of a herd, helping the BML anticipate when it might be necessary to prepare some mustangs for adoption.</p>
<p>The table below gives the total number of mustangs in Nevada since 2000.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horse_data.png" alt="">
Since the population decreased and then started to increase, it seems reasonable that a transformation of the square function $f(x)=x^{2}$ might fit the data.</p>
<p>In the figure below the vertex form of a quadratic is shown along with the data.  Adjust the values of $\color{blue}{a}$, $\color{brown}{h}$ and $\color{green}{k}$ until you find a good fit for the data.</p>

<p>With data sets like this one it is hard to know which combination of transformations will make the curve fit the data the best.  In instances like this it is often best to let technology find the equation for us.</p>
<p>Most graphing calculators have a quadratic regression program <code>QuadReg</code> that finds a quadratic equation fitting the data.  Here we will show the steps for the Texas-Instruments 83/84 series of calculators.</p>
<p>We start by entering the data into the calculator by pressing the <code>STAT</code> button and selecting <code>1: Edit</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horse_regression_1.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The data is entered into the <code>L1</code> and <code>L2</code> lists.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horse_regression_2.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>To view the scatterplot, press <code>2ND</code> and <code>Y=</code> to enter the <code>STAT PLOTS</code> menu,  then select the first plot and make sure it is turned on.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horse_regression_3.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Using <code>9:ZoomStat</code> in the <code>ZOOM</code> menu gives a good viewing window for the data.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horse_regression_4.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Once we have confirmed the shape of the data, we go back to the <code>STAT</code> menu and this time choose the <code>CALC</code> tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horse_regression_5.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This reveals all of the regression models built into the calculator, letting us choose the model that we think visually matches the shape of the data.  Since this data looks like the square function, we choose <code>5: QuadReg</code>.  If the data had looked like a line then <code>4: LinReg(ax+b)</code> would have been a good choice.</p>
<p>After running <code>5: QuadReg</code> we are shown the equation that fits the data.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horse_regression_6.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The result is given in the standard form $y = a x^{2} + b x + c$ rather than in the vertex form we used when trying to fit the data by hand.  Copying this equation into the graphing window shows that it fits the data reasonably well.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/horse_regression_7.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>We could now use the equation $y=239.8x^2-3147.9x+24397.8$ as the basis for a model of the wild mustang population in Nevada.</p>
<p>It bears repeating that a mathematical model is not the same as the real object, nor does it control the behavior of the real thing.  For instance, this model might <em>predict</em> the future number of wild mustangs, but it is in no way a guarantee of what will happen.</p>

<p>The Pompidou Center in Paris has an amazing escalator. Designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano and British designer Richard Rogers, the 6 story escalator is encased in a glass tube and attached to the outside of the building!</p>
<p>The Pompidou escalator is not a single straight line, but rather several small lines pieced together.  It's an example of a new type of function which we'll call <strong>piecewise-defined</strong> functions.  For instance, to model the Pompidou escalator we shift and stretch several pieces of the identity function and connect them together with horizontal line segments.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/pompidou_model.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Piecewise-defined</strong> functions, such as this, give us a lot more flexibility when creating models.  No longer are we required to find a single function; we are now free to construct models in multiple pieces.</p>
<p>When writing piecewise functions, we list the equations for each piece and then specify where each is used.  Consider, for example, the path a bounding ball.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/piecewise_bounce.gif#center" alt="https://people.rit.edu/andpph/photofile-misc/stroboscope/bouncing-ball-7791m.jpg"></p>
<p>Each bounce is an individual parabola, with its own equation, and its own limited domain.  The piecewise function for this particular ball is</p>
<p>[ f(x)=\begin{cases}
-(x+2)(x-2) &amp; \text{if } &amp; 0 \leq x \leq 2 \newline
-1.2(x-2)(x-5) &amp; \text{if } &amp; 2 &lt;  x \leq 5 \newline
-1.8(x-5)(x-7) &amp; \text{if } &amp; 5 &lt; x \leq 7
\end{cases}
]</p>
<p>To find a value such as $f(4)$, we first compare our x-value $4$ with the three inequalities.  Since $4$ would fit in $2&lt;x \leq 5$, we must use the second equation.  Thus, $f(4)=-1.2(4-2)(4-5) =2.4$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Use the piecewise function above to evaluate the following:</p>

</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In the chapters that follow, we will encounter new functions that increase our ability to model real life scenarios, but the basic process will be the same. We will always start by comparing the properties of the data with the behaviors of functions we know.  Then we use transformations and/or technology to fit a model to the data.  The model can be used to interpolate and/or extrapolate unknown values.</p>
<p>If the model predicts unreasonable values that do not make any sense, then we should try to explain how we know the result is an error and why it might have occurred.  An analysis of the errors can often lead to the construction of a more robust model.</p>
<p>And while our models will never be perfect, there is a good chance that they might be accurate enough to be useful.  Physicist Eugene Wigner has referred to the predictive nature of mathematics, especially in the natural sciences, as the <em>&quot;unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.&quot;</em>  This is something that we will see more of in the next chapters.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Part of the enjoyment of art comes from its patterns of sound and color and motion.</p>
<p>Patterns are also an essential part of mathematics.  The British mathematician G. H. Hardy once said that <em>&quot;A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.   If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>In this section, we will find an underlying structure that unifies the <a href="//chapter-1/1.3#graphs-of-basic-functions">six basic functions from Chapter 1</a> and opens up a new category of functions for our use.</p>
<h2 id="power-functions">Power Functions</h2>
<p>When working with a group of functions, the first pattern we look for is any similarity in the <em>form</em>, or equation, of the functions.  Once we have identified a pattern, we can create new functions by changing the parameters of that basic equation.</p>
<p>For instance, these three functions</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
\text{identity function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= x = x^1 \newline
\text{square function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= x^{2} \newline
\text{cube function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= x^3 \newline
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>are all written in the form $f(x)=x^{p}$, where $p$ is the power of the variable $x$.  New functions can be made by taking that basic format and changing the power $p$.  Since the power is the important parameter of the equation, we will call these <em>power</em> functions.</p>
<p>In general, a <strong>power function</strong> is any function that can be written as $f(x)=x^{p}$, where $p$ is a constant.  Notice that the variable must be raised to a fixed power.  That power can be positive or negative, a whole number, a fraction or a decimal, but it cannot be a variable.  As an example, $g(x)=3^{x}$ has a variable exponent, so it cannot be a power function even though it looks somewhat similar.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Decide if the following are power functions or not.  If it is, identify the value of the power $p$.</p>

</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="use-rules-of-exponents-to-identify-power-functions">Use Rules of Exponents to Identify Power Functions</h2>
<p>We now know that the identity, square and cube are all power functions, but what about the other basic functions from Chapter 1?  At first glance, these functions</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align}
\text{reciprocal function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{x} \newline
\text{square root function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= \sqrt{x} \newline
\text{cube root function} &amp;&amp; f(x) &amp;= \sqrt[3]{x}
\end{align}
$$</p>
<p>do not appear to be power functions since they are not written in the form $f(x)=x^{p}$.</p>
<p>However, any function that <em>can</em> be written as $f(x)=x^{ p}$ is a power function, even if it is often written in a different format.  A brief review of a few rules of exponents will show that these three functions are indeed power functions.</p>
<h3 id="negative-powers">Negative Powers</h3>
<p>You might recall the rule $\frac{1}{x}=x^{-1}$.  This tells us that the <em>reciprocal function</em> $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$  is the same as the power function $f(x) =  x^{-1}$.  The general rule of exponents at work here is</p>
<p>[
\frac{1}{x^{n}}=x^{-n}
]</p>
<p>This rule can be used to convert any reciprocal-type function into a power function.  For instance, $f(x)=\frac{1}{x^{5}}$ can be rewritten in the standard power function format as $f(x)=x^{-5}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Rewrite the following functions in the standard power function form.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>$f(x)=\frac{1}{x^{2}}$<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />$f(x)=x^{-2}$</details></p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="roots">Roots</h3>
<p>Another rule of exponents allows us to rewrite roots as fractional powers.  Specifically,</p>
<p>$$
\sqrt[m]{x}  =  x^{1/m}
$$</p>
<p>From this we see that the <em>square root</em> function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ and the <em>cube root</em> function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ can be written as power functions where the powers are $1/2$ and $1/3$, respectively.</p>
<p>[
f(x)=\sqrt{{x}}  =  x^{1/2}
]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$
f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}  =  x^{1/3}
$$</p>
<p>Other roots can be rewritten as power functions in the same way.  For instance, $f(x)=\sqrt[8]{x}   =  x^{1/8}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Rewrite the following functions in the standard power function form.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>$f(x)=\sqrt[5]{x}$<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />$f(x)=x^{1/5}$</details></p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="fractional-powers">Fractional Powers</h3>
<p>The family of power functions also includes roots of powers, such as $f(x)=\sqrt[m]{x^{n}}$ , or powers of roots like $f(x)=(\sqrt[m]{x})^{n}$, which happen to be the same thing.  These can be rewritten as power functions where the power is a rational number, or faction, of the form $p=n/m$, such as $-3/8$ or $2/5$.</p>
<p>$$
\sqrt[m]{ x^n }  =  \left(\sqrt[m]{x}\right)^{n}  =  x^{n/m}
$$</p>
<p>Since all three forms are equivalent, you may be asked to convert one into the others.  The power function $f(x)  = x^{2/5 }$, for instance, can also be written as  $f(x) =  \sqrt[5]{x^{2}}$ or as $f(x) =  (\sqrt[5]{x})^2$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Rewrite the following functions in the other two formats.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="inverses-of-power-functions">Inverses of Power Functions</h2>
<p>Finding the inverse of a power function is a very straightforward process.  As an illustration, consider the cube function $f(x) =  x^{3}$ and its inverse, the cube root function $f^{-1}(x) =  \sqrt[3]{x}$.</p>
<p>Since the cube root can be written as the one-third power $x^{1/3}$, the inverse of $f(x)=x^{3}$ is the power function $f^{-1}(x)=x^{1/3}$.</p>
<p>Notice that the two powers are <em>reciprocals</em> of each other, that is the key.</p>
<p>In general, the inverse of any power function restricted to $x\geq0$ is the power function whose power is the reciprocal of the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/reciprocal_power.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>That is to say, given some power function $f(x)=x^{p}$, then its inverse is always $f^{-1}(x)=x^{1/p}$, for all powers other than $p=0$ (which does not have an inverse).</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Find the inverse of the following power functions.</p>

<h2 id="graphs-of-power-functions">Graphs of Power Functions</h2>
<p>Now let's turn our attention to identifying patterns in the graphs of power functions. The shape of the graph of a power function $f(x)=x^{ p}$ is controlled by the value of the power $p$.  In this interactive figure you can use the <strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong> slider to change $p$.</p>
<p>Since many powers are undefined when $x&lt; 0$, we will focus on the first quadrant for now.   As you change $p$, look for patterns or similarities between the different graphs.  In particular, try to group the graphs into three distinct shapes.</p>

</div>
<p>As you may have noticed, all power functions pass through the point $(1,\ 1)$, though they do so in three different ways depending on the power $p$.  The three behavior patterns are separated from one another by $p=0$ (when we get the horizontal line $y=1$) and $p=1$ (when we get the identity function $y=x$).</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/powers_all_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>In Chapter 1 you learned how to identify several characteristics of a function by reading its graph.  Since understanding the properties of these three shapes will impact you ability to use power functions effectively, our next goal must be to analyze each of these shapes individually.</p>
<h3 id="case-1-colorredp0">Case 1: $\color{red}{p&lt;0}$</h3>
<p>Let's start our analysis with the case where the power is negative, that is $p&lt;0$.  Notice that this graph resembles the right side of the <a href="//chapter-1/1.3#the-reciprocal-function">reciprocal function</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_a.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at the graph we see that it drops sharply along the y-axis and levels off toward the positive x-axis, as you move from left to right.  In mathematical terms, the graph is both decreasing and concave up on the interval $(0, \infty)$, with a vertical asymptote at $x=0$ (the y-axis) and a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$ (the x-axis).</p>
<p>Because of the asymptotes, the graph never reaches a minimum nor a maximum value.  Based on the shape of the graph, it would be reasonable to use this type of power function to represent quantities that decay as $x$ increases.</p>
<h3 id="case-2-colorgreen0p1">Case 2: $\color{green}{0&lt;p&lt;1}$</h3>
<p>If the power is small, that is $0&lt;p&lt;1$, then the graph of the power function $f(x)=x^{p}$ is increasing and concave down over the interval $(0, \infty)$.   Note that this graph resembles the <a href="//chapter-1/1.3#the-square-root-function">square root function</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_b.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The graph has a minimum value at $(0, 0)$, but does not have a maximum or any asymptotes.  Since the graph is concave down, the rate of increase is decreasing, suggesting that this type of power function might model quantities whose growth is slowing down.</p>
<h3 id="case-3-colorbluep1">Case 3: $\color{blue}{p&gt;1}$</h3>
<p>When $p&gt;1$, the power function $f(x)=x^{p}$ increases and is concave up on the interval $(0, \infty)$.   This graph resembles the right side of the <a href="//chapter-1/1.3#the-square-function">square function</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_c.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>There is a minimum value at the origin $(0, 0)$, but no maximums or asymptotes.  These functions will be useful when modeling quantities that grow faster and faster.  Lastly, note that this graph, along with the two previous ones, is one-to-one and must have an inverse.</p>
<h2 id="symmetry-of-power-functions">Symmetry of Power Functions</h2>
<p>So far, we have restricted our attention to power functions with $x \geq 0$ because many powers not defined when $x&lt;0$.</p>
<p>However, if the power is a rational number, or faction, of the form $p =\color{blue}{n}/\color{green}{m}$, then the function <em>might</em> be defined for $x&lt;0$, in which case the graph would have a left side.</p>
<p>In this interactive figure you can adjust the value of the numerator $\color{blue}{n}$ and the denominator $\color{green}{m}$.  As you do so, keep in mind the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>For which values of $\color{green}{m}$ does the left side of the graph exist?</li>
<li>When the left side exists, for which values of $\color{blue}{n}$ is the graph symmetric across the y-axis (ie. even symmetry) and for which is the graph symmetric around the origin (ie. odd symmetry)?</li>
</ul>
<div class="no-print geogebra" style="padding-top: 40%;margin-bottom:0.5rem; ">

</div>
<p>From the interactive figure we can see that if $p =\color{blue}{n}/\color{green}{m}$ (and all common factors of $\color{blue}{n}$ and $\color{green}{m}$ have been cancelled), then the function only has a left side when the denominator $\color{green}{m}$ is odd.</p>
<p>Additionally, when denominator $\color{green}{m}$ is odd, the function displays even symmetry if the numerator $\color{blue}{n}$ is even and
odd symmetry if the numerator $\color{blue}{n}$ is odd.</p>
<p>Understanding this allows us to answer questions about a power function just by inspecting it's equation.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Which of the following are defined when $x&lt;0$?</p>

<h2 id="use-symmetry-to-graph-power-functions">Use Symmetry to Graph Power Functions</h2>
<p>Knowing how the values of $\color{blue}{n}$ and $\color{green}{m}$ affect the symmetry of $f(x)=x^{p}$ with $p = \color{blue}{n} / \color{green}{m}$ also allows us to sketch the graph of a power function very quickly.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, $f(x) =  x^{\color{blue}{2}/\color{green}{3}}$.  The power $p =\color{blue}{2}/\color{green}{3}$ is between $0$ and $1$, so the graph of this function looks similar to the basic shape for $0&lt;p&lt;1$, which resembles the square root function.  The denominator $\color{green}{3}$ is an odd number, which tells us that this function has a left side.  And since the numerator $\color{blue}{2}$ is even, we should reflect the right side across the y-axis to create a graph with even symmetry.  Thus, the graph of $f(x) =  x^{2/3}$ looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_2_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>If the numerator had been odd, such as $f(x) =  x^{5/3}$ then we would have reflected around the origin instead, ending up with this rough sketch:</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_5_3.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that the shape of the right side of $f(x) =  x^{5/3}$ is similar to the right side of the square function, since $5/3&gt;1$.</p>
<p>In summary, to sketch the graph of a power function with a rational exponent, first choose the basic that matches the power $p$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/power_functions.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Then use the symmetry rules to draw the other half of the graph, if it exists.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the denominator $\color{green}{m}$ is odd, then the function also exists when $x&lt;0$ so it has a left side.</li>
<li>When $\color{green}{m}$ is odd, the function has even symmetry if $\color{blue}{n}$ is even and odd symmetry if $\color{blue}{n}$ is odd.</li>

<h2 id="how-power-functions-change">How Power Functions Change</h2>
<p>We can also find patterns in the way power functions change.  In particular, the difference quotients of power functions have a very intriguing property.</p>
<p>You will recall that the difference quotient $D(x)$ is a function that lets us calculate the average rate of change on a generic interval $[x, x+h]$, where $h$ is any positive number.  The difference quotient of a function is given by</p>
<p>[
D(x)=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
]</p>
<p>Below are the difference quotients for the power functions $f(x)=x^{2}$ and $f(x)=x^3$.</p>

<p>Notice that the difference quotient of each power function is similar to the next smaller power function.  In general, the difference quotient of $f(x)=x^{p}$ will involve the power function $f(x)=x^{p-1}$ for any $p\neq0$.  This is a fact that is verified in the first term of calculus.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In this section we discovered that the basic library functions could all be written in an identical algebraic form.  We then used that common form to create a new category of functions, whose properties we explored.   This is a process that will be repeated in later chapters as well.  We'll start with functions we understand and then create new functions that have slightly different algebraic forms and investigate their properties.</p>
<p>An understanding of the properties and behaviors of functions is essential when trying to deduce which mathematical model will be the best fit for a particular set of data.  That knowledge is also helpful when working with applications, which is where we will head next with power functions.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In 1687 Isaac Newton published <em>Principia</em>, one of the most important books in the history of science. 
<label for="sn-note about braces" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-note about braces" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote"> <img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/Prinicipia-title.png" alt=""><br> A rare first edition copy of <em>Principia</em> sold at auction for $3.7 million in 2016.</span>
In <em>Principia</em> Newton formulated his three laws of motion, expanded Kepler's work on planetary orbits, laid the foundations for classical mechanics and, for the first time ever, gave a mathematical description of gravity.</p>
<p>Newton wrote that the gravitational force between two objects is <em>&quot;proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>In this section we'll spend time trying to figure out what Newton meant by that and uncover a few other applications of power functions along the way.  But before we do that, we need to quickly discuss some tips and tricks for evaluating power functions.</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-power-functions">Evaluating Power functions</h2>
<p>When using a calculator to evaluate power functions we need to be careful to wrap $x$ and/or $p$ in parenthesis anytime either one anything other than a whole number. For example, if $f(x)=x^{2/5}$ then to evaluate $f(-3/8)$  parenthesis should be put around both $-3/8$ and around the power $2/5$.  Without parenthesis, the normal order of operations would give a very different answer.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Correct evaluation of $(-3/8)^{2/5}$</strong></th>
<th><strong>Incorrect evaluation of $(-3/8)^{2/5}$</strong></th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>(-3/8)^(2/5) = 0.675480019</code></td>
<td><code>-3/8^2/5 = -0.009375</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We should also keep in mind that many power functions are not defined when $x&lt;0$, and that if the power is negative then $0$ is not in the domain.  Expressions involving either of these will produce an error message on your calculator.</p>

<h2 id="the-standard-power-function-model">The Standard Power Function Model</h2>
<p>Most power functions applications require us to scale the basic form $f(x)=x^{p}$ by a factor of $k$.  The resulting equation</p>
<p>[
f(x) =  k x^{p}
]</p>
<p>is called the <strong>standard power function model</strong>.</p>
<p>To understand how $k$ impacts the model let's focus on the effect this has on a single point.</p>

<p>This causes a vertical scaling of the graph by a factor of $k$ s that all power functions of the form $f(x)=k x^{p}$ must pass through the point$(1, k)$.</p>
<p>In many cases the scaling factor $k$ is composed of more than one constant.  For instance, the volume of a sphere is a function of the of the radius and is given by $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$.  Here the constant $k$ includes both the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\pi$, that is $k=\frac{4}{3} \pi$.</p>

<p>Light, fast boats are often designed to skim, or <em>plane</em>, across the surface of the water.  However, when a large, heavy boat moves it must push the water out of it's way.  This creates a wave at the bow (front) of the boat.  As it tries to go faster and faster the wave gets bigger and bigger.

<p>When the length of this wave matches the length of the boat, then the boat has reached its <em>hull speed</em> $V$, which is generally considered to be the fastest it can go.  The hull speed of a large ship doesn't depend at all on the size of its motor(s) or how heavy it is.  Hull speed is actually a function of the ship's length and is given by the power function</p>
<p>[
V=1.34 L^{1/2}
]</p>
<p>where $V$ is the hull speed in knots and $L$ is the length of the boat at the water line in feet.</p>
<p>One surprising aspect of this model is that it not only works for large boats, but for waterfowl like ducks and geese since they make bow waves too.

<h3 id="pendulums">Pendulums</h3>
<p>A pendulum is any object that swings from a fixed point.  A playground swing and a grandfather clock are two example of pendulums.  In one tower of the Oregon Convention Center, the 900 pound <em>Principia</em> pendulum hangs from a 70 foot long cable as it swings.

<p>Surprisingly, the amount of time that it takes a pendulum to swing back and forth once (called its period) doesn't depend at all on how heavy it is.  The period of a pendulum depends only on the length of the cable and is given by the power function</p>

<p>Italian scientist Galileo Galilei is reported to have dropped two spheres of different masses from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and observed that both hit the ground at the same time.  He concluded that the time it takes an object to fall is independent of its weight.  In other words,  if air resistance is removed, a light object, like a feather, will fall just as fast as a heavy object, like a hammer.</p>
<p>On Earth, the time it takes an object to fall, ignoring air resistance, is given by the power function</p>
<p>[
t=\frac{1}{4} d^{1/2}
]</p>
<p>where $t$ is time in seconds and $d$ is the distance in feet.  This was famously verified on the Moon by the astronauts of Apollo 15 in 1971, who captured the event on video.

<p>According to reports, the blimp tossed out another ball which he caught as well.  The baseball reached a top speed of about 95 miles per hour due to the air resistance.  We'll look at air resistance in Section 2.3.</p>

<h2 id="direct-variation">Direct Variation</h2>
<p>Many applications, especially in science and engineering, are expressed in the language of variation.  Our focus here is on the vocabulary and converting between verbal and symbolic descriptions.  Solving equations is left for the next section.</p>
<p>Two quantities $x$ and $y$ are said to <strong>vary directly</strong>
<label for="sn-variation" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-variation" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">Variation is sometimes called <strong>proportionality</strong>.  The phrase &quot;$y$ <strong>varies directly</strong> with $x$&quot; means the same as &quot;$y$ is <strong>directly proportional</strong> to $x$&quot;.</span>
if $y$ is a constant <em>multiple</em> of $x$.  Algebraically this means that</p>
<p>[
y =  k \thinspace x
]</p>
<p>for any constant $k$.</p>
<p>The number $k$ is called the <strong>constant of variation</strong>.  Whenever $x$ increases by $1$ then $y$ will increase by a factor of $k$.</p>
<p>While we normally think of $x$ and $y$ as single variables, they could also be algebraic expressions.  For instance, Kepler's third law describes a directly proportional relationship between a square and a cube.  It states that the square of the time it takes a planet to orbit the Sun (called its period) varies directly with the cube of its distance from the Sun.  The equation is $P^2 =  k \thinspace D^{3}$.</p>
<p>In this case the two quantities that are proportional are $P^2$ and $D^{3}$.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to us are equations of the form $y =  k \thinspace x^{p}$, where $y$ varies directly with the $p$-th power of $x$.  Note that this is nothing more than our standard power function model with a different name.</p>
<p>Recall, for instance, that the volume of a sphere is given by the power function $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$ where $r$ is the radius.  Using the terminology of variation, we can also say that volume is proportional to the cube of the radius, with a constant of variation of $\frac{4}{3} \pi$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Describe each of the following power functions using the terminology of proportionality and identify the constant of proportionality.</p>
<ol>

The constant of proportionality is $13.71$</details></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="inverse-variation">Inverse Variation</h2>
<p>When $y =  k x^{p}$ and the power is negative, there is another phrase that is used to describe the relationship between $x$ and $y$.  If</p>
<p>[
y =  k \thinspace x^{-n}  =  k \frac{1}{x^{n}} , n&gt;0
]</p>
<p>then $y$ varies <strong>inversely</strong> with $x^n$.  Notice that being inversely proportional to $x^n$ is the same as being directly proportional to $x^{-n}=\frac{1}{x^{n}}$.  For example, if  $y =  4 x^{-3}$, then $y$ is inversely proportional to $x^{3}$.</p>
<p>If two quantities vary inversely, then one increases when the other decreases, and vice versa.  This is in contrast to direct variation where both quantities increase, or decrease, at the same time.</p>
<p>Two quick examples should illustrate the difference.  When cooking rice, the amount of water needed is <em>directly</em> proportional to the amount of rice.  If you want to cook more rice, you'll need more water. However, the time it takes to drive a car around a race track is <em>inversely</em> proportional to the speed of the car.  The faster the car travels, the less time it will take to do a lap.</p>

<p>One example of inverse variation is Boyle's Law.  According to Boyle's Law, if the temperature of a gas in a sealed container is held constant, then the volume of the gas is inversely proportional to the pressure applied.  Algebraically this means that</p>
<p>[
P=k \thinspace V^{-1}
]</p>
<p>where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, and the constant $k$ depends on the initial condition of the gas.</p>
<p>To see why this might be useful, suppose that a medical syringe contains $0.1$ cubic centimeter of air when it is closed and that $k=0.103$ kilogram-centimeters.  Then the pressure in the syringe is</p>
<p>[
P=0.103(0.1)^{-1}=1.03 \text{ kilograms per square centimeter}
]</p>
<p>If the plunger of the syringe is pulled back, increasing the volume to $5.0$ cubic centimeters, then the pressure drops to</p>
<p>[

<p>Physics shows that the stopping distance $d$ of a car is directly proportional to the square of its speed $v$ and inversely proportional to the friction $\mu$ between the tires and the road.</p>
<p>It also tells us that the constant of proportionality is $k =  \frac{1}{2 g}$, where $g =  32 \text{ft/sec}^{2}$ is the acceleration of gravity.</p>
<p>Symbolically we have the following formula</p>
<p>[
d =  \frac{1}{(2)(32)}{ v^2 } \frac{1}{\mu}  =  \frac{v^{2}}{64\mu}
]</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the size and weight of the vehicle are not part of the equation.   More importantly, from a safety standpoint, is the fact that doubling the speed $v$ results in a quadrupling of the stopping distance $d$.</p>
<p>Suppose you are driving $60$ mph down a snowy road and suddenly slam on the brakes.  When will you come to a complete stop?  We now know the equation, but before we can use it we need the friction coefficient $\mu$.  Finding the exact value of the friction coefficient is difficult, but traffic engineers have calculated approximate values for different surfaces.

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-stopping" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/friction_coefficients.svg" alt=""></span></p>
<p>In this case we will use $\mu =  0.2$, since the car is on snow. Lastly, we should convert our speed from $60$ miles per hour (mph) to $88$ feet per second (ft/sec).  Substituting these values into our equation gives a stopping distance of</p>
<p>[
d =  \frac{88^{2}}{64(0.2)}  = 605 \text{ feet}
]</p>
<p>So if you were travelling at 60mph down a snow covered road, it would take at least 605 feet for your car to stop once you had applied the brakes.</p>

<h3 id="newtons-universal-law-of-gravity">Newton's Universal Law of Gravity</h3>
<p>As a final example let's now turn our attention to Newton's law of gravity.  Isaac Newton discovered that the force of gravity $F$ between two objects, like the Sun and the Earth, is proportional to the product of their two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $d$ between them.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/gravity.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>In equation format, we have</p>
<p>[
F =  k \frac{m_1 m_2 }{d^{2}}
]</p>
<p>As a random fact, the units of $F$ are called &quot;Newtons&quot;, in his honor.  One Newton is roughly equal to the weight of an apple, about 1/4 of a pound.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Do skydivers fall at a constant speed or do they go faster and faster the longer they fall?  Is there anything they can do to control their speed or is it completely out of their hands?</p>
<p>After we spend a moment outlining the basic solving process for power functions, we will return to these questions.</p>
<h2 id="techniques-for-solving-power-equations">Techniques for Solving Power Equations</h2>
<p>Since most equations involving power functions will be of the form $y =  k x^{p}$, the steps for solving all of them are essentially the same. First we  make sure that $x^{p}$ is isolated.  Once that has been done, we can solve for $x$ by taking the reciprocal power $1/p$ of both sides of the equation.  In general it would look like this:</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
y &amp;=   k x^{p} \newline
\frac{y}{k} &amp;=   x^{p} &amp;&amp; \text{Divide both sides by }k \newline
x &amp;=   \left( \frac{y}{k} \right)^{1/p} &amp;&amp; \text{Apply the } 1/p \text{ power to both sides}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>Thus, the solution to $y =  k x^{p}$ is given by $x =   \left( \frac{y}{k} \right)^{1/p}$.  This assumes, of course, that $p \neq 0$.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that if $\frac{y}{k}&lt;0$, then $x =   \left( \frac{y}{k} \right)^{1/p}$ may not be a real number and the equation would have &quot;no real number solutions&quot;.</p>
<p>Let's consider one concrete example.  Suppose we need to solve $80 =  5 x^{2}$.  The solving steps will be to first divide by $5$ and then apply the $1/2$ power.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
80 &amp;= 5 x^{2} \newline
16 &amp;= x^{2} &amp;&amp; \text{Divide both sides by 5.}\newline
x &amp;= \pm (16)^{1/2} &amp;&amp; \text{Apply the 1/2 power to both sides.} \newline
x &amp;= \pm 4 &amp;&amp; \text{Simplify.}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>In this case there are two $x$ values that solve the equation.  Anytime $p$ is even we might have multiple solutions.  And while only positive solutions have significance for many applications, we should not dismiss negative solutions without good cause.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Use the process above to solve the following equations for $x$, if possible.  Do not simplify your answers.</p>

<p>When reconstructing accident scenes, police officers rely on a number of tools, including measuring the length of any skid marks made by the tires.  With that distance, and an assessment of the road conditions, they can approximate the speed of the vehicle.</p>
<p>So how do they do it? In the prior section we saw how to calculate the stopping distance $d$ using the formula</p>
<p>[
d =  \frac{v^{2}}{64\mu}
]</p>
<p>where $v$ is the speed of the car in feet per second and $\mu$ is the friction coefficient of the road surface.</p>
<p>When police need to find the speed of a car that was involved in an accident they measure the distance of the skid marks, make an observation of the road conditions, and solve this equation for $v$.</p>
<p>Suppose a police investigator finds $286$ foot long skid marks along a snowy road.  How fast was the car going?  To answer this question we insert the known value for $d$ and the estimated $\mu$ from the table 
<label for="sn-stopping" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-stopping" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/friction_coefficients.svg" alt=""></span>
and solve for $v$.   The result is</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
286 &amp;=   \frac{v^{2}}{64(0.2)} \newline
3660.8 &amp;=   v^{2} &amp;&amp; \text{Multiply both sides by } 64(0.2)=12.8 \newline
v &amp;=   (3660.8)^{1/2} &amp;&amp; \text{Apply the } 1/2 \text{ power to both sides} \newline
v &amp;\approx\ 60.5 &amp;&amp; \text{Evaluate}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>The officer can safely conclude that the car was going at least 60.5 feet per second, which converts to 41.3 miles per hour using 1 mile = 5280 feet and 1 hour = 3600 seconds as follows:</p>
<p>[
\frac{60.5 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ sec}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{5280 \text{ feet}} \cdot \frac{3600 \text{ sec}}{1 \text{ hour}} \approx41.3 \text{ mph}
]</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>If 180 foot long skid marks are found on wet concrete, what was the speed of the car? <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />With $d=180$ feet and $\mu=0.6$, we have
[
\begin{align}
180 &amp;=   \frac{v^{2}}{64(0.6)} \newline
6912 &amp;=   v^{2} &amp;&amp; \text{Multiply both sides by } 64(0.6) \newline
v &amp;=   (6912)^{1/2} &amp;&amp; \text{Apply the } 1/2 \text{ power to both sides} \newline
v &amp;\approx 83.1 &amp;&amp; \text{Evaluate}
\end{align}
]
So $v \approx 83.1$ ft/sec, which is almost $56.7$ mph.</details></div>
<p>It is easy to see that the police might need to repeat this process on a regular basis.  To simplify the work needed, it makes sense to create a formula for $v$ by solving the equation $d =  \frac{v^{2}}{64\mu}$ for $v$ without inserting values for $d$ and $\mu$.  The result is</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
d &amp;=  \frac{v^{2}}{64\mu} \newline
64\mu d &amp;=  v^2 &amp;&amp; \text{Multiply both sides by } 64\mu \newline
v &amp;=  (64\mu d)^{1/2} &amp;&amp; \text{Apply the } 1/2 \text{ power to both sides} \newline
v &amp;=  8 \sqrt{\mu d  } &amp;&amp; \text{Simplify}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>assuming $v&gt;0$.</p>
<p>This formula will give the same results as solving, but is more efficient and less prone to error.  In general, when a calculation needs to be repeated frequently, it's best to find a formula rather than repeating the solving process over and over.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Use the formula above find the speed of a car that left 180 foot long skid marks on wet concrete, which has a friction coefficient of $\mu=0.6$.

<p>The force of aerodynamic drag $D$ acting on a skydiver is directly proportional to four parameters: the square of the velocity $v$, the density of air $\rho$, the drag coefficient $C$, as well as the amount of surface area $A$ that is facing the ground, where the constant of proportionality is $1/2$.  From this information, is it possible to find a formula for velocity?</p>
<p>We start by converting the language of proportionality into an equation.  Translating the statement above, we obtain the equation</p>
<p>[
D =  \frac{1}{2} \rho C A v^2
]</p>
<p>Solving for $v$ gives the following formula:</p>
<p>[
v =  \left(\frac{2 D}{ \rho C A}\right)^{1/2} =  \sqrt{\frac{2D}{\rho C A}}
]</p>
<p>Of the four values ($D$, $\rho$, $C$ and $A$)  that determine velocity, a skydiver has little control over $D$ and $\rho$.  The drag force $D$ can never be greater than the skydiver's weight, otherwise they would float instead of fall, and the density of air $\rho$ at lower altitudes is fairly consistent at about $1.1  kg/m^{2}$.</p>
<p>A skydiver can, however, alter their shape which will affect both surface area $A$ and the drag coefficient $C$. 
<label for="mn-drag_coefficient" class="margin-toggle">⊕

<input type="checkbox" id="mn-drag_coefficient" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="marginnote"><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/drag_coefficient.svg#center" alt=""></span></p>
<p>For example, suppose a skydiver weighing $734$ Newtons (about 165 lbs) goes into a head-first dive.  How fast might they fall?</p>
<p>In this instance we know $D=165$ and $\rho=1.1$, but we'll have to make some assumptions for $A$ and $C$.</p>
<p>Assuming a stable head down position, a surface area of about $A=0.3 \thinspace m^{2}$ is reasonable, and let's choose a value for $C$ that is a little lower than that of a cylinder, say $C=0.7$.</p>
<p>With these values in place, we can evaluate $v$.</p>
<p>[
v =  \sqrt{\frac{2D}{\rho C A}} =  \sqrt{\frac{(2)(734)}{(1.1)(0.7)(0.3)}} \approx\ 79.7 \thinspace m/s
]</p>
<p>Our model predicts that the maximum speed (sometimes called <em>terminal velocity</em>) of this skydiver in a stable head-first dive is $79.7 \thinspace  m/s$, or around $178 \thinspace mph$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Imagine that our skydiver changes to a flat position so that their surface area is $A=0.6  m^{2}$ and $C$ increases to $1.0$.  What is the maximum speed under these conditions?</p>
<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />With $A=0.6$, $C=1.0$ and $D$ and $\rho$ as before, velocity is calculated as [ v =   \sqrt{\frac{(2)(734)}{(1.1)(1.0)(0.6)}} \approx 47.16 \thinspace m/s ]
which is approximately $105.5 \thinspace mph$.</details>

<h2 id="find-the-inverse-of-a-power-function">Find the Inverse of a Power Function</h2>
<p>The steps we have gone through to solve equations are essentially the same steps needed to find the inverse of a power function.  Recall that the inverse of a basic power function $f(x)=x^{p}$ is the power function $f^{-1}(x)=x^{1/p}$ whose power is the reciprocal of the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-1/reciprocal_power.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course, this assumes $p \neq 0$ and that we have restricted the domain if $f(x)=x^{p}$ is not one-to-one, such as in the case of $f(x)=x^{2}$.  Finding the inverse of a standard power function model of the form $f(x) =  k x^{p}$ will require the use of the <em>shoes and socks</em> method, since it contains two operations.</p>
<p>To find the inverse of $f(x) =  3 x^{1/5}$, for example, we focus on identifying the operations performed by the function and then invert the list to find the operations of the inverse function.</p>

<p>One of the applications in <a href="../2.2#tugboats">Section 2.2</a> allowed us to find the hull speed of a boat using the function</p>
<p>[
V = 1.34 L^{1/2}
]</p>
<p>where $V$ is the hull speed in knots and $L$ is the length of the boat in feet at the water line.  Since $V$ is a function of $L$, the inverse function, if it exists, will make $L$ a function of $V$.  That is to say, if $V=f(L)$, then $L=f^{-1}(V)$.  This means that $f^{-1}$, if we can find it, could be used to figure out how long a boat needs to be in order to achieve a particular hull speed.</p>
<p>To find the inverse of $V=f(L) = 1.34 L^{1/2}$ we begin by recognizing that this function first uses the $1/2$ power and then multiplies by $1.34$.  The inverse must do the opposite operations in the reverse order: first dividing by $1.34$ and then applying the $2/1=2$ power.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the inverse function does, we construct its equation as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Start with a variable:</th>
<th>$V$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Divide by $1.34$:</td>
<td>$\frac{V}{1.34}$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Apply the $2$ power:</td>
<td>$\left(\frac{V}{1.34}\right)^{2}$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Write as a function:</td>
<td>$L=f^{-1}(V) =  \left(\frac{V}{1.34}\right)^{2}$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Lastly, to ensure that $f^{-1}$ is one-to-one itself we should add the condition that $V\geq0$.</p>
<p>How might this new function get used?  Suppose the Navy needs to design a new aircraft carrier with a hull speed of at least $V= 33$ knots.  By evaluating $L=f^{-1}(30)$ the engineers could quickly know that the boat should be at least 606.48 feet long.</p>
<p>Note that the same answer can be found by inserting $V=33$ into the original function and <em>solving</em> for $L$.  In other words, evaluating the inverse function is essentially the same as solving the original function.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Suppose you want to build a canoe that will have a hull speed of $V = 5$  knots.

<p>The number of AOL subscribers (in millions) can be approximated by the power function $S =  f(t) =  16.32 t^{-0.84}$
where $t$ is time in years since 2005.  What is the inverse of this function, and what significance might it have?</p>
<p>Using the techniques discussed earlier, the inverse function is</p>
<p>[
t =  f^{-1}(S) =  \left(\frac{S}{16.32}\right)^{1/-0.84}
]</p>
<p>This function is useful because it allows us to approximate the time, in years since 2005, when AOL will have $S$ million subscriptions.</p>
<p>Many companies sell off divisions of their business when that part of the company shrinks.  Suppose, for instance, that AOL plans to sell off their dial-up service once the number of subscribers drops to 1,000,000.  To find out when that would happen we evaluate the inverse function when $S=1$.</p>
<p>[
f^{-1}(1) =  \left(\frac{1}{16.32}\right)^{1/-0.84}\ \approx\ 27.78
]</p>
<p>This suggest that AOL would continue to offer dial-up internet for about 28 years, until the year 2033.  Of course, this assumes that our original model for the number of AOL subscriptions will continue to hold, which is never a sure thing.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In the next section we will discuss how to take data, like the AOL data, and create power function models that fit the data closely.  Those models can then be used to predict important future behavior.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When Johannes Kepler came up with his theory for the orbit of planets in 1618, he was only aware of six planets:  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.  Kepler based his theory on measurements taken years earlier by Tycho Brahe who made all of his observations with the naked eye--the telescope was invented 8 years after his death.</p>
<p>Given the technological limitations of the day, is there any chance these 400 year-old theories are still useful today?</p>
<h2 id="keplers-third-law">Kepler's Third Law</h2>
<p>Kepler struggled for 17 years to find a relationship between the time it takes a planet to orbit the Sun (called its orbital period) and its average distance from the Sun (called the semi-major axis).  Eventually he settled on the &quot;sesquialternate proportion&quot;, a fancy way to say the $3/2$ power.</p>
<p>By using the <code>PwrReg</code> program in a calculator we should be able to do the same thing in just a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>The table below lists the periods and distances for the 8 major planets in our solar system.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/planets.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>We start by entering the data into a calculator</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/kepler_data.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>and taking a look at the scatterplot.  Using <code>9: ZoomStat</code> gives a good viewing window.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/kepler_scatterplot.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The scatterplot definitely looks like it could be a power function, so we run <code>PwrReg</code></p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/kepler_equation.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>and get back the equation $y=x^{1.5}$.  Graphing this equation along with our scatterplot shows that it is a very good fit.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/kepler_fit.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>If we write the power $1.5$ as $3/2$ then we have the same model as Kepler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The orbital period $P$ of a planet, in years, can be modeled by the equation
[ P =  D^{3/2} ]
where $D$ is the distance of the planet from the Sun in astronomical units (AU).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that including a description of the variables is an essential part of making a model.  If the data had been measured in days instead of years, or miles instead of astronomical units, then the equation would be different.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4>Kepler discovered his third law by studying planets.

<p>In the natural sciences, many other aspects of an organism's life are connected to its size. Life expectancy, brain size, gestational period, metabolic rate, just to name a few, all depend on body mass. The study of the relationship of body size to shape, anatomy, physiology and behavior is called &quot;allometry&quot;.  Very often allometric data is best modeled by power functions.</p>
<p>For example, the accompanying table shows the weight and cruising speed of several birds.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/bird_data.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>A scatterplot of the data suggests that a slowly increasing power function with $0&lt;p&lt;1$ might model the data well.</p>

Running the `PwrReg` program gives $f(x) =  23.66 x^{0.2}$ as the best fit, confirming our initial observation that $0 < p < 1$.
<p>We can use this function to predict the flying speed of other animals based on their weight.  For instance, the giant golden-crowned flying fox is one of the heaviest bat species, with some individuals weighing up to $3.1$ pounds.  At that weight we would predict an optimal flying speed of $f(3.1) =  23.66 (3.1)^{0.2}=29.67 \text{ mph}$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Check to see if this function works for an airplane like the Cessna 172 Skyhawk, which has a cruising speed of $140 \text{ mph}$ and weighs $2300 \text{ pounds}$.</p>
<details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />This model predicts a flying speed of [ f(2300) =  23.66 (2300)^{0.2} = 111.27 \text{ mph} ] which isn't too far off the actual value of $140 \text{ mph}$.</details>

<h2 id="book-sales">Book Sales</h2>
<p>In the previous examples, the independent variables were well defined.  However, it is sometimes possible to fit a power function to data even if there is no independent variable.  In such cases, it is common to sort the data from largest to smallest and use the rank as the x-value.  For instance, $x=1$ corresponds to the largest value, $x=2$ corresponds to the second largest value, and so on.</p>
<p>One place to find ranked data is in a best-selling book list.  This table shows some of the best-selling books in the United Kingdom from 1998 though the end of 2011.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-2/Top_books_UK.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Since the values decrease, if a trend exists it will resemble a decreasing power function, one where the power is negative.</p>

A scatterplot of the book data shows a pattern that appears to match the shape of a power function with $p<1$.  Using a power regression program, we find the power function that fits this data best is
<p>[
f(x)=5408784.21 x^{-0.46}
]</p>
<p>Eric Carle's children's book <em>The Very Hungry Catepillar</em> is ranked 54th on the list.  According to our model, the number of copies sold should be</p>
<p>[
f(54) = 5408784.21(54)^{-0.46}\approx 863373
]</p>
<p>which is fairly close to the 855,920 actually sold.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><p>Use the function above to estimate the ranking of John Grisham's book <em>The Summons</em>, which sold 677,378 copies, by solving for $x$ when $f(x)=677378$. <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" /><p>[

<p>While this model fits the overall trend of the data very well, we should not expect it to perfectly match every value.</p>
<p>For instance, the Census shows that Kansas City, Missouri was ranked 37th with a population of 459,787.  However, our model predicts a population of $f(37)\approx433,642$.  That's reasonably close, but not perfect.</p>
<p>This is a common occurrence with many models and we should be cautious about expecting perfection from them.</p>

<p>In this chapter we've seen that power functions fit are used in a wide variety of applications.  Even so, there are lots of times when a power function isn't a good fit.</p>
<p>The data below might look like they could be modeled by a power function, but no mater which values you choose for $k$ and $p$, the power function will never fit the curvature of the scatterplot.</p>

<p><strong>UNDER REVISION</strong></p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize linear, exponential, and proportional relationships from verbal descriptions.</li>
<li>Interpret the meaning of coefficients and constants in the context of the modeled situations.</li>
<li>Apply algebraic techniques to create equations of linear, power, and exponential functions that model real-life scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Many people are concerned about the amount of mercury they ingest by eating fish such as shark, swordfish, and tuna.  Mercury levels in large fish can be over a million times higher than that found in the surrounding waters.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, many things that we eat have <em>biological half-lives</em>, and we know that things with half-lives can be modeled by exponential functions.</p>
<p>In this section we will point out key words and descriptions that indicate a scenario might be modeled by a particular type of function.  We'll also cover algebraic methods for finding those equations.</p>
<h2 id="identifying-functions-from-descriptions">Identifying Functions from Descriptions</h2>
<h3 id="linear-functions-constant-rates">Linear Functions: Constant Rates</h3>
<p>When we investigated how functions change in <a href="https://duragauge.github.io/chapter-1/1.6">Chapter 1</a>, we saw that the average rate of change formula was nothing more than the slope formula rewritten with function notation.  Since the slope of a line doesn't change, we can say that the average rate of change of a linear function is always constant.</p>
<p>A constant <strong>rate</strong> is the key here.  A rate is ratio of two quantities.  Most often these are described using the word <em>per</em> (miles <em>per</em> gallon, servings <em>per</em> package, dollars <em>per</em> hour, feet <em>per</em> second) or something equivalent (two forks <em>for each</em> plate, 10000 steps <em>every</em> day).  That constant rate of change is the slope of the linear function.</p>
<h3 id="exponential-functions--constant-percentages">Exponential Functions:  Constant Percentages</h3>
<h3 id="power-functions--proportional-changes">Power Functions:  Proportional Changes</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that frequently occurring things are often much smaller than things which occur rarely. For example, small diamonds are common, but large diamonds like the 45.52 carat Hope Diamond are extremely rare. Or the world population of blue whales is much smaller than that of the common house fly.</p>
<p>Craters on the Moon have a similar pattern.  There are very few large craters but millions of small ones.</p>
<p>In the natural sciences, many other aspects of an organism's life are connected to its size. Life expectancy, brain size, gestational period, metabolic rate, just to name a few, depend on body mass. These connections are often called &quot;power laws&quot;, because they involve power functions.</p>
<p>With only two data points it's hard to be sure.  Could be exponential.  Logarithms could be used....to check</p>
<p>In this third example we will plot points from the power function $y=x^{2}$ on a standard plot, where both axis are linear, along side a  log-log plot, where both axis are logarithmic.</p>
<p>$ln(y) =</p>

<h3 id="elimination-example---find-a-logarithmic-function-given-2-points">Elimination Example - Find a Logarithmic Function Given 2 Points</h3>
<p>Suppose we need to find a logarithmic function through the two points $(5, 3)$ and $(20, 9)$.  We'll use the format $f(x)=a+b \ln x$ so that we can use <code>LnReg</code> to double check our answer.</p>
<p>As we have done earlier, we begin by substituting the $x$ and $y=f(x)$ coordinates into the equation of our model to generate a system.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
9 &amp;= a+b \ln 20 &amp;&amp; \small \text{Equation #1} \newline
3 &amp;= a+b \ln 5 &amp;&amp; \small \text{Equation #2}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>Notice that if we were to subtract the two equations then $a$ would be eliminated.  That is our elimination step.</p>
<p>[
\begin{array}{l r c l}
&amp; 9 &amp; = &amp;  a+b \ln 20 \newline
-   &amp; (3 &amp; = &amp; a+b \ln 5 ) \newline
\hline
&amp; 6 &amp; = &amp;  b \ln 20 - b \ln 5
\end{array}
]</p>
<p>The result of the elimination is a new equation that only has $b$ in it.  After we solve this for $b$ we can substitute that value back into one of our equations and find $a$.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
6 &amp;= b \ln 20 - b \ln 5 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Original Equation}} \newline
6 &amp;= b \left(\ln 20 - \ln 5 \right) &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Factor out $b$}} \newline
6 &amp;= b \ln \left(\frac{20}{5} \right) &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Use Quotient rule for Logs}} \newline
6 &amp;= b \ln 4 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Simplify fraction}} \newline
\frac{6}{\ln 4} &amp;= b &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Divide by $\ln 4$}} \newline
b &amp;\approx 4.328 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Decimal approximation}} \newline
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>The next step is to find $a$ by substituting $b=\frac{6}{\ln 4}$ into one of our equations.  Either equation will work, but we'll pick Equation #2 since it looks a bit simpler.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
3 &amp;= a+b \ln 5 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Equation #2}} \newline
3 &amp;= a + \frac{6}{\ln 4} \cdot \ln 5 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Substitute $b = \frac{6}{\ln 4}$}} \newline
3 - \frac{6}{\ln 4} \cdot \ln 5 &amp;= a &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Subtract $\frac{6}{\ln 4} \cdot \ln 5$}} \newline
a &amp;\approx -3.966 &amp;&amp; \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Decimal approximation}} \newline
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>Now that we have both $a$ and $b$, we can write out our function.</p>
<p>[f(x) =  -3.966+4.328 \ln x]</p>
<p>A quick way to check this is to run logarithmic regression on the limited data set $(5, 3)$ and $(20, 9)$.</p>
<p><img src="https://duragauge.github.io/img/chapter-6/log_regression_2_points.svg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>This gives the same values for $a$ and $b$ and the graph clearly goes through our two points.</p>
<h2 id="identify-systems-of-linear-equations">Identify Systems of Linear equations</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful tools for solving systems is a matrix method called Gauss-Jordan Elimination, which is programed into most graphing calculators.</p>
<p>Gauss-Jordan Elimination is designed to solve systems of <em>linear</em> equations.  You might assume this means it is only good for finding lines, but that is not the case.</p>
<p>The system we solved a moment ago was actually a linear system, even though the equations came from a logarithmic model.  Let's look at it again.</p>
<p>[
\begin{align}
9 &amp;= a+b \ln 20 &amp;&amp; \small \text{Equation #1} \newline
3 &amp;= a+b \ln 5 &amp;&amp; \small \text{Equation #2}
\end{align}
]</p>
<p>These equations are linear because $a$ and $b$ have a power of $1$ and are combined using only addition.  If the equations had powers/roots or exponents/logs or products of $a$ and $b$ then they would not be linear.</p>
<p>x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x</p>
<h2 id="convert-between-exponential-models">Convert Between Exponential Models</h2>
<p>continuous vs not --- doesn't really matter since we can switch between equations.</p>
<p>When working with exponential models it is important to realize that there are many ways to write the same function.  Specifically, the following models are equivalent.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Standard model:</th>
<th>$f(x)=a \thinspace b^{x}$, where $b=1+r$</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Continuous growth model:</td>
<td>$f(t)=a \thinspace e^{k  t}$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It is possible to convert from one form to the other using $b=e^{k}$ or $k = \ln (b)$.  Either form can be used for any application.  The only difference is whether its preferable to emphasize the growth factor $b$ or the continuous growth rate $k$.  It is even possible to switch to a doubling time or a half-life model.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

<p>A common experiment in college biology labs is to incubate bakers' yeast in a petri dish filled with a nutrient-rich solution.  As the yeast grows groups of cells, called colonies, begin to appear as small white balls.</p>
<p>Suppose you initially see $3$ yeast colonies.  You come back $24$ hours later the number of colonies has jumped to $87$.</p>
<p>To find a continuous growth function $f(t)=a \thinspace e^{k  t}$ that models the number of yeast colonies we must first use the given data to find the continuous growth rate $k$.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>
<li>Using $a=3$, $t=24$ and $f(t)=87$ find the equation we must solve to find $k$.  You do not need to solve the equation.</li>

<p>To solve $87=3 e^{k(24)}$ for $k$, we proceed as follows:</p>

<p>We now know that the yeast are growing at a continuous rate of 14%, and that the function modeling their growth is</p>
<p>[
f(t)=3 e^{0.14 t}
]</p>
<p>models the number of yeast colonies $t$ hours after the experiment began.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success"><h4>QUICK CHECK</h4><ol>

<p>We were told that there were 87 yeast colonies after 24 hours.

<li>
<p>In this example, the yeast were growing at a continuous rate of $k=0.14$, or 14%.  Use the fact that $b=e^{k}$ to convert the function $f(t)=3 e^{0.14 t}$ into the standard form $f(x)=a \thinspace b^{x}$.  Then identify the growth factor and growth rate. <details class='no-print' style="margin-left:0.7rem;border-style: solid;"><summary style="cursor:pointer;">Answer</summary><hr style="height:0px; visibility:hidden;" />Since $b=e^0.14\approx1.15$ the growth factor is $1.15$ and the growth rate is $r=0.15$, meaning the yeast grow 15% per hour.  The function $f(x)=3(1.15)^{x}$ is the standard form of the continuous growth function $f(t)=3 e^{0.14 t}$.</details></p>

<p>Many people are concerned about the amount of mercury they ingest by eating some kinds of fish.  When small fish eat collect in large predatory fish such as shark, swordfish, and tuna.

Mercury levels in large fish can be over a million times higher than that found in the surrounding waters.</p>
<p>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) believes that if a person has a blood mercury level under 5.8 micrograms per liter ($\mu$g/L) then they are relatively safe and should see no adverse effects.</p>
<p>Suppose the Mercury level in your blood is at 15 $\mu$g/L.  If 5 days later it has only dropped to 14  $\mu$g/L, how long will it take to reach a safe level?</p>
<p>If we assume mercury leaves your body in a continuous fashion, then we can try to find a model of the form $f(t)=ae^{k t}$.  From the information given we can find $k$ by solving  $14=15e^{k \thinspace 5}$.</p>

<p>This shows that the half-life of mercury in the body is about 50 days.  By taking $c=50$, we conclude that the function</p>
<p>[
f(x)=15\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x/50}
]</p>
<p>is the half-life model for mercury concentration that is equivalent to our earlier continuous decay model.  Both both produce the same values, they are just written in different formats.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In the two sections that follow, we will use transformations and/or technology to find models that fit larger sets of data, but the basic process will be the same as what we've done here.</p>
<p>We will always start by comparing the properties of the data with the behaviors of functions we know so that we can choose an appropriate function model that can be used to predict unknown values.</p>
<p>If the model predicts unreasonable values that do not make any sense, then we should try to explain how we know the result is an error and why it might have occurred.  An analysis of the errors can often lead to the construction of a more robust model.</p>

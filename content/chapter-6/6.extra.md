textbook on applications of linear algebra that mentions tomography  https://books.google.com/books?id=SkiYDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA626&ots=b5CmFlFRsw&dq=linear%20system%20pixels&pg=PA620#v=onepage&q=linear%20system%20pixels&f=false

Solving a system is not always possible and there is an entire field of mathematics, linear algebra, devoted to studying systems and their solutions.

We won't be able to explore the depths of linear algebra but, generally speaking, the number of equations in a system should match the number of unknown values for there to be a chance of solving the system.  To solve for $6$ values, for instance, you typically need $6$ equations.

The number of unknown values in many applications is often huge.  If you view the color of a single pixel on a screen as a single unknown value, then it's easy to see why there might be hundreds and thousands of equations involved in solving a single system.

The system we will work with will only have a few unknown values, but the basic solving techniques are used on systems of all sizes.

substitution, elimination, and using technology

There is even an entire branch of mathematics devoted to studying systems and their solutions, so the subject is much deeper than what we can cover here.


### Substitution Example 2 - Find Power Function Given 2 Points
$f(x)=k \thinspace x^{p}$

$(2, 5)$
$(6,10)$

$5=k \thinspace 2^{p}$
$10=k \thinspace 6^{p}$

\[
\begin{align}
\frac{5}{10} &= \frac{k \thinspace 2^{p}}{k \thinspace 6^{p}} \newline
\frac{1}{2} &= \frac{2^{p}}{6^{p}} \newline
\frac{5}{10} &= \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^{p} \newline
\frac{5}{10} &= \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{p} \newline
\ln \left(\frac{5}{10}\right) &= \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{p} \newline
\ln \left(\frac{5}{10}\right) &= p  \thinspace  \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \newline
p &= \frac{\ln \left(\frac{5}{10}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}
\end{align}
\]

## Solve Systems of Linear Equations with Technology
The most efficient way to represent a system do Gauss-Jordan elimination is to convert a system into a matrix and input that matrix into a calculator.  


augmented matrix

each line is shorthand notation for an equation

0 for missing variables

## Applications of Systems of Equations

### 3x3 systems for quadratic regressions
$$f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$$
### Story Problems

### Splines?

In computer graphics not only do you need to connect two points, but you need that segment to join smoothly with other segments.  So the equation for one section should depend in part on the sections next to it.


Array
\[
\begin{array}{c}
1x+2y+3z=4 \newline
5x+5y+5z=0 \newline
2x-2y+2z=-2
\end{array}
\]

Align
\[
\begin{align}
1x+2y+3z&=4 \newline
5x+5y+5z&=0 \newline
2x-2y+2z&=-2
\end{align}
\]

A system like this could be used to find the three coefficients of a quadratic function.

6ax_2+2b-6ex_2-2f=0 \newline
6ax_1+2b=0 \newline
6ex_2+2f=0

## Circle Through 3 Points
$$a(x^2+y^2)+bx+cy+d=0$$
Nope, no can do at this level.  This requires using determinants.

## Cubic Through 4 Points
$$f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=y$$
In these equations the values of x’s and y’s are assumed to be known, so we can view this as a linear system in the unknowns a0, a1, . . . , an−1.

## Introduction
When shopping for cookie ingredients at a grocery store it makes no difference if you grab eggs or flour first.  As long as you get everything on your list you'll be fine.

But when following the recipe, the order of each step is important. If instead of creaming the butter with the sugar you accidentally mix it with flour first, the cookies won't turn out right.

In mathematics, **sequences** are like recipes in that order is important.

## Recursive Sequences

When we plot sequences we do not end up with a nice, continuous curve.  Instead we get a bunch of dots.

1. Discuss the differences between the function $f(x)=2x+3$ and the sequence $a_{n}=2n+3$

Decide if the sequence $-4, -1, 2, 5, 8, \dots$  is arithmetic or geometric.  Then give it's formula.

Decide if the sequence $1, -3, 9, -27, 81, -243, \dots$  is arithmetic or geometric.  Then give it's formula.

Decide if the sequence $5, 2, -2, -6, -11 , \dots$  is arithmetic or geometric.  Then give it's formula.


13.	Suppose a house, originally purchased in 1963 for $12,000, increases in value 10% per year.  
	(a)	Write a sequence which describes the value of the home.  

	(b)	What is that house worth today?

	(c)	Will this sequence be finite or infinite?

14.	Suppose you bought a $1500 computer in 2004 and that its value is dropping by $450 dollars per year.  
	(a)	Write a sequence describing the value of the computer.  

	(b)	What is the computer worth today?

While Gauss figured this formula out on his own, it had been known for several hundred years at the time since Fibonacci published it in 1202.  

Problem 3 :
If a clock strikes once at 1'o clock,twice at 2'o clock and so on.How many times will it strike a day?

Solution :

The clock strikes once at 1'o clock,twice at 2'o clock and so on.Now we have to write this pattern as series because we need to find number of times that the clock strike a day.

  = 2 [1 + 2 + 3 + ............ + 12]
  = 2 x (n/2) [a+L]
  = 2 x (12/2) [1+12]
  = 12 [13]
  = 156

Therefore the clock will strike 156 times in a day.

$$\Biggl(\biggl(\Bigl(\bigl((x)\bigr)\Bigr)\biggr)\Biggr)$$

$$\sum\_{n=5}^{65} (380 - 2(n-1)) $$
Since $n$ starts $4$ above where it normally does, there are $65-4=61$ terms to be added.  Also the first term we are including isn't $a_1=380$, it is $a_5=380-2(5-1)=372$.

$$\frac{61}{2}(372+252)$$

Chessboard would have \$184,467,440,737,095,516.15 on it, if you want to be precise.



## Evaluating Summation Notation
Series written in summation notation can still be evaluated using the formulas we developed earlier.

The connection between the two is that $S_n$
$$\Large S_n \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k$$

Just because something is written in
1. Evaluate $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}4(0.5)^{n−1}$.
1. Evaluate $\sum_{n=1}^{20} 6 − 2(n − 1)$.

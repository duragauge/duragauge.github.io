## Introduction
Many people are concerned about the amount of mercury they ingest by eating certain species of large fish like shark, swordfish, and tuna.  Mercury levels in large fish can be over a million times higher than that found in the surrounding waters, posing a possible health risk.

An accurate mathematical model could help people understand those concerns and make informed decisions.  Fortunately, the elimination of substances like mercury from the body are known to have *biological half-lives*, and we know that half-lives can be modeled with exponential functions.  

In this section we'll will point out key words and phrases, like "half-life", that indicate a scenario might be modeled by a particular type of function.  We'll also cover algebraic methods for finding those equations.


## Identifying Functions from Descriptions
### Linear Functions: Constant Rates
When we studied how functions change in [Chapter 1](/chapter-1/1.6), we saw that the average rate of change formula was nothing more than the slope formula rewritten with function notation.  

Since the slope of a line remains consistent throughout, the key to identifying a linear function is to spot a constant rate of change.

It helps to remember that a **rate** is ratio of two quantities.  Such rates are often described using the word *per* (miles *per* gallon, servings *per* package, dollars *per* hour, feet *per* second) or something equivalent (two tickets *for each* person, ten-thousand steps *every* day, etc.).  

Whatever that constant rate of change is, it will be the slope of the linear function.

### Power Functions:  Proportional Changes
Back in [Chapter 2](/chapter-2/2.2) when we introduced the ideas of direct and inverse proportionality, all the examples explicitly stated the type of proportionality.  Without specific guidance like that, we'll need to look for other clues.

Specifically, if two quantites increase or decrease together, then they might vary directly.  On the other hand, if one goes up while the other goes down, then they could vary inversely.

While those behaviors don't exclusively belong to power functions, they do indicate that a power function should be considered.

### Exponential Functions:  Constant Percentages
As we saw in [Chapter 3](/chapter-3/3.2) exponential functions often appear in scenarios involving growth or decay that follows a multiplicative pattern. 

A distinguishing features of exponential functions is that they involve a constant **percentage change** over equal intervals.  Almost without exception, if a constant percent change is mentioned within a certain time frame, then the scenario is likely exponential in nature.

## Writing Functions from Descriptions
Once we've chosen a function model that seems to fit the description, the next task is to write the equation of that function.  

If a starting value is given, then the equations for linear and exponential functions can generally be written without much trouble.  Power functions will require two known values, so we'll delay looking at them for a moment.

### Writing Linear Functions
As we saw in the previous section, the **slope-intercept** form of a linear function is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.

To pull the slope and y-intercept out of a description, look for the following:
- The slope $m$ is the constant rate of change of the function.
- The y-intercept $b$ is a starting value, which is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$.

For instance, suppose a gym has an initial signup fee of $\\$50$ and monthly membership fee of $\\$20$.  In this scenario, the initial signup fee acts as the y-intercept and the monthly fee is the slope.  Using $m=20$ and $b=50$ the equation of the linear function is:
\[ y = 20x + 50 \]
This linear function allows us to calculate the total cost of the gym membership based on the number of months ($x$).


### Writing Exponential Functions
In [Chapter 3](//chapter-3/3.2) we learned that the general form of an exponential function is $y = ab^x$, where $a$ is the initial value (or starting amount) and $b$ is the base (growth/decay factor).  

So, much like a linear function, we only need two parameters to write the equation of an exponential function.  To extract these from a description, look for the following:
- The initial value $a$ is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$. It represents the starting point of the exponential growth or decay.
- The base $b$ is the factor by which $y$ changes for each unit change in $x$. If $b > 1$, it represents exponential growth; if $0 < b < 1$, it represents exponential decay.  If a percentage rate $r$ is given then the base is $b=1+r$ for growth and $b=1-r$ for decay.  If the change takes $c$ units to occur, then $x$ should be divided by $c$.

As a simple example, suppose an aspiring social influencer has $400$ followers and expects that number to grow by $3\\%$ every month.  Then $y=400(1.03)^x$ allows us the calculate how many followers they have after $x$ months.

## Creating Functions from Two Points
In many cases we may have to determine the parameters of a function from two pairs of data.  This can apply to any of the three types of functions we're looking at in this section.

### Linear Functions
The first step in finding a linear function through two points is to use the slope formula 
\[m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\] 

Once we have the slope in hand we can finish the process with either the point-slope form or the slope-intercept form.  Many people prefer the slope-intercept form since it is more familiar, but the point-slope form is actually easier to work with.  We'll do the same example both ways and you can decide for yourself.

For our example, let's use the points $(2,5)$ as $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(6,-1)$ as $(x_2,y_2)$.  We'll start with the slope

\[
  \begin{align}
  m &= \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{slope formula}} \newline
  &= \frac{-1 - 5}{6-2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{insert coordinates of the two points}} \newline
  &= \frac{-6}{4} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{evaluate the subtractions}} \newline
  &= -\frac{3}{2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{reduce the fraction}} \newline
  \end{align}
\] 

To finish this with the slope-intercept form we need to find the y-intercept $b$.  This is done by taking putting the coordinates of either point into the equation and solving for $b$.  We will use $(2,5)$ and, of course, $m = \frac{-3}{2}$.

\[
  \begin{align}
    y &= m  + b && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{slope-intercept form}} \newline
    5 &= -\frac{3}{2}(2)+b && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{insert the slope and the coordinates of the point}} \newline
    5 &= -3+b && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{simplify}} \newline
    8 &= b && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{add $3$ to both sides}}
  \end{align}
\]

We now have $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+8$ as our linear model in the slope-intercept form.

Since the point-slope form only requires the coordinates of a point and the slope, we can get the equation just by substituting.  Here we will also use $(2,5)$ and $m = \frac{-3}{2}$.

\[
  \begin{align}
    y &= m(x-x_1)  + y_1 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{point-slope form}} \newline
    y &= -\frac{3}{2}(x-2)+5 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{insert the slope and the coordinates of the point}}
  \end{align}
\]

We now have $y=-\frac{3}{2}(x-2)+5$ as our linear model in the point-slope form.  It is important to point out that these are the same exact equation, just in different formats.  This can be seen clearly if we start with point-slope form, distribute the slope and simplify.

\[
  \begin{align}
    y &= -\frac{3}{2}(x-2)+5 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{point-slope form}} \newline
    y &= \left(-\frac{3}{2}\cdot x\right)-\left(-\frac{3}{2}\cdot 2\right) + 5 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{distribute the slope}} \newline
    y &= -\frac{3}{2}x + 3 + 5 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{simplify the multiplication}} \newline
    y &= -\frac{3}{2}x + 8 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{simplify the addition}}
  \end{align}
\]

The end result is the same slope-intercept form we found earlier.

### Power Functions
Suppose we are asked to find a standard power function that passes through $(6, 10)$ and $(2, 5)$.  Since power functions are not lines, we cannot use the slope formula and must use different techniques.

On thing that will help is to remember that each point has an $x$ and a $y=f(x)$ coordinate. Substituting those values into the standard power function equation $f(x)=kx^p$ will give us a pair of equations to work with.

![](/img/chapter-6/substitution_power.svg#center)

 
 We start by forming a ratio of $10 = k (6)^{p}$ and $5=k (2)^{p}$

\[
\begin{align}
\frac{10}{5} &= \frac{k (6)^{p}}{k (2)^{p}} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Form a ratio of the two equations.}} \\newline
\frac{10}{5} &= \frac{6^{p}}{2^{p}} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Cancel $k$.}} \\newline
\frac{10}{5} &= \left(\frac{6}{2}\right)^p && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Use the rule $\frac{a^x}{b^x}=\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{x}$.}} \\newline
2 & = 3^p && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Reduce the fractions.}} \\newline
\ln(2) &= \ln \left(3^{p}\right) && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Apply a logarithm to both sides.}} \\newline
\ln(2) &= p \cdot \ln (3) && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Use the power rule for logarithms.}} \\newline
\frac{\ln(2)}{\ln(3)} &= p && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Divide to isolate $p$.}} \\newline
p &\approx 0.6309 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Decimal approximation.}}
\end{align}
\]

### Substitution Example - Find an Exponential Function Given 2 Points
Suppose we are asked to find an exponential function $f(x)=a \thinspace b^{x}$ that passes through the points $(1, 12)$ and $(3, 27)$.  There are two values we don't know, $a$ and $b$, so we need a system of two equations.

To turn what we know into a system we need to remember that each point has an $x$ and a $y=f(x)$ coordinate.  Inserting those values into the exponential equation will give us two equations.

![](/img/chapter-6/substitution_exponential.svg#center)

Those two equations are our system.

\[
\begin{align}
12 &= a  \thinspace  b^{1} && \small \text{Equation #1} \newline
27 &= a  \thinspace  b^{3} && \small \text{Equation #2} \newline
\end{align}
\]

To solve our system by substitution we should first solve one of these equations for one of the unknown values, either $a$ or $b$.  It makes no difference which equation or which value we pick, so look for the one that seems simplest.

Since Equation \#1 has the lower power, let's use it to solve for $a$.

\[
\begin{align}
12 &= a  \thinspace  b^{1} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Equation #1}} \newline
\frac{12}{b} & = a  && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Divide by $b$}} \newline
\end{align}
\]

This next step is the key to substitution.  We take this expression for $a$ and substitute it into the other equation, Equation \#2.

\[
\begin{align}
27 &= a  \thinspace  b^{3} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Equation #2}} \newline
27 & = \frac{12}{b}  \thinspace  b^{3}  && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Substitute $a=\frac{12}{b}$}} \newline
27 & = 12 b^{2}  && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Simplify powers of $b$}} \newline
\frac{27}{12} &= b^{2}   && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Divide by 12}} \newline
\frac{9}{4} &= b^{2}   && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Simplify fraction}} \newline
\pm \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} &= b   && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Take $\pm \sqrt{\text{  }}$}} \newline
\pm \frac{3}{2} &= b  && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Simplify}} \newline
\end{align}
\]

Normally getting two answers could cause a problem, but in this case we know something extra.  We are trying to find the base of an exponential function, and the base of an exponential is never negative.  So the correct value must be $b=\frac{3}{2}$.

This is only half of the solution; we also need to know what $a$ is.  To find that, we'll substitute $b$ back into one of our equations.  As before, either one will work but we'll choose Equation \#1 since it is a bit simpler.

\[
\begin{align}
12 &= a  \thinspace  b^{1} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Equation #1}} \newline
12 & = a \frac{3}{2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Substitute $b = \frac{3}{2}$}} \newline
\frac{2}{3} \cdot 12 &= a && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Multiply by $\frac{2}{3}$}} \newline
8 &= a && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Simplify}} \newline
\end{align}
\]

Now that we know the values for $a$ and $b$, we can finally say that

\[f(x)=8 \left(\frac{3}{2} \right)^{x}\]

is the exponential function that passes through the points $(1, 12)$ and $(3, 27)$.

12 b^{2} &= 27   && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Multiply by $b^2$}} \newline
b^{2} &= \frac{27}{12} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Divide by $12$}} \newline

b &= \pm \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Take $\pm \sqrt{\text{  }}$}} \newline
b &= \pm \frac{3}{2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Simplify}} \newline
\end{align}
\]
which is the same result we had when using Equation \#1.

### Exponential Functions
Suppose we are asked to find a standard exponential function that passes through $(2, 4)$ and $(6, 10)$.  You'll recall that each point has an $x$ and a $y=f(x)$ coordinate.  For instance, the point $(2, 4)$ tells us that $x=2$ and $f(x)=4$ while the point $(6, 10)$ means $x=6$ and $f(x)=10$.  

 By inserting those values for $x$ and $f(x)$ into the standard exponential form $f(x)=a \thinspace b^{x}$ we create a system of two equations.   

 $$4=a  \thinspace  b^2 \text{ and } 10=a \thinspace b^6$$

 Since neither equation is equal to $0$ we can form their ratio, eliminate $a$, and find $b$.  Once $b$ is known, we can substitute it into one of these equations to find $a$.  

 We start by forming a ratio of $4=a \thinspace b^2$ and $10=a \thinspace b^6$.

\[
\begin{align}
\frac{10}{4} &= \frac{a \thinspace b^{6}}{a \thinspace b^{2}} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Form a ratio of the two equations.}} \\newline
\frac{5}{2} &= \frac{b^{6}}{b^{2}} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Cancel $a$.}} \\newline
\frac{5}{2} &= b^{4} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Simplify the powers of $b$.}} \\newline
b &= \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/4} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{Apply the $1/4$ power to both sides.}} \\newline
b &\approx 1.26 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{calulator approximation.}}
\end{align}
\]
 Now that we have a value for $b$, we substitute it into either of the initial equations to find $a$.

\[
\begin{align}
4 &=  a\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use the exponent rule $(x^n)^{m}=x^{nm}$.}} \\newline 
a &=  4\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{-1/2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{1/2}$.}} \\newline
a &\approx 2.53 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Decimal approximation.}}
\end{align}
\]

 Thus, the exponential function that passes through the points $(2,4)$ and $(6,10)$ is $f(x)=2.53(1.26)^{x}$.





This is why leads to the phenomenon of "biological half-lives" you mentioned earlier. The concept of a half-life is based on the idea that, within a certain time frame, a quantity changes by the same percentage.


You may have noticed that frequently occurring things are often much smaller than things which occur rarely. For example, small diamonds are common, but large diamonds like the 45.52 carat Hope Diamond are extremely rare. Or the world population of large fish like the whale shark is much smaller than that of tiny fish like sardines.

Craters on the Moon have a similar pattern.  There are very few large craters but millions of small ones.



In the natural sciences, many other aspects of an organism's life are connected to its size. Life expectancy, brain size, gestational period, metabolic rate, just to name a few, depend on body mass. These connections are often called "power laws", because they involve power functions.

With only two data points it's hard to be sure.  Could be exponential.  Logarithms could be used....to check

## Convert Between Exponential Models

continuous vs not --- doesn't really matter since we can switch between equations.


When working with exponential models it is important to realize that there are many ways to write the same function.  Specifically, the following models are equivalent.

|Standard model: | $f(x)=a \thinspace b^{x}$, where $b=1+r$ |
| --- | --- |
|Continuous growth model: |  $f(t)=a \thinspace e^{k  t}$ |

It is possible to convert from one form to the other using $b=e^{k}$ or $k = \ln (b)$.  Either form can be used for any application.  The only difference is whether its preferable to emphasize the growth factor $b$ or the continuous growth rate $k$.  It is even possible to switch to a doubling time or a half-life model.

## Create Exponential Models
### Population Growth
![](/img/chapter-3/petri_dishes.png#center)

A common experiment in college biology labs is to incubate bakers' yeast in a petri dish filled with a nutrient-rich solution.  As the yeast grows groups of cells, called colonies, begin to appear as small white balls.

Suppose you initially see $3$ yeast colonies.  You come back $24$ hours later the number of colonies has jumped to $87$.

To find a continuous growth function $f(t)=a \thinspace e^{k  t}$ that models the number of yeast colonies we must first use the given data to find the continuous growth rate $k$.  

{{% check %}}
1. Using $a=3$, $t=24$ and $f(t)=87$ find the equation we must solve to find $k$.  You do not need to solve the equation.
{{% answer %}}We need to solve the equation $87=3 e^{k \thinspace 24}$ for $k$.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}

To solve $87=3 e^{k(24)}$ for $k$, we proceed as follows:
\[\begin{align}
87 & =3 e^{k(24)} \\newline
\frac{87}{3} &=  e^{24  k} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $3$ to isolate the exponential.}} \\newline
\ln\left(\frac{87}{3}\right) &=  \ln\left(e^{24  k}\right) && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Apply the natural log $\ln$ to both sides.}} \\newline
\ln\left(\frac{87}{3}\right) &=  24 k && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use the inverse relationship $\ln\left(e^{x}\right)=x$}} \\newline
\frac{\ln\left(\frac{87}{3}\right)}{24} &= k && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $24$.}} \\newline
k  &\approx  0.140 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Decimal approximation.}} \end{align}
\]

We now know that the yeast are growing at a continuous rate of 14%, and that the function modeling their growth is

\[
  f(t)=3 e^{0.14 t}
\]

models the number of yeast colonies $t$ hours after the experiment began.

### Continuous Biological Decay

Many people are concerned about the amount of mercury they ingest by eating some kinds of fish.  When small fish eat collect in large predatory fish such as shark, swordfish, and tuna.{{% sidenote "fish"%}}![](/img/chapter-6/MercuryFoodChain.svg#center){{% /sidenote %}}  Mercury levels in large fish can be over a million times higher than that found in the surrounding waters.  

The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) believes that if a person has a blood mercury level under 5.8 micrograms per liter ($\mu$g/L) then they are relatively safe and should see no adverse effects.

Suppose the Mercury level in your blood is at 15 $\mu$g/L.  If 5 days later it has only dropped to 14  $\mu$g/L, how long will it take to reach a safe level?

If we assume mercury leaves your body in a continuous fashion, then we can try to find a model of the form $f(t)=ae^{k t}$.  From the information given we can find $k$ by solving  $14=15e^{k \thinspace 5}$.

\[ \begin{align}
14 =& 15e^{k \thinspace 5} \newline
\frac{14}{15} &= e^{5 \thinspace  k} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $15$ to isolate the exponential.}} \newline
\ln\left(\frac{14}{15}\right) &= \ln\left(e^{5 k}\right) && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Apply the natural log $\ln$ to both sides.}} \newline
\ln\left(\frac{14}{15}\right) &= 5 k && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use the inverse relationship $\ln(e^{x})=x$.}} \newline
\frac{\ln\left(\frac{14}{15}\right)}{5} &= k && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $5$.}} \newline
k  &\approx  -0.0138 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use a calculator to find a decimal approximation.}} 
\end{align}\]

From this we see that the mercury concentration can be modeled by $f(t)=15e^{-0.0138  \thinspace  t}$.  

{{% check %}}
1. Now that we know the model is $f(t)=15e^{-0.0138 \thinspace t}$, how do we figure out the amount of time it will take to reach a safe level of  5.8$\mu$/L?
{{% answer %}}We need to set $f(t)=5.8$ and solve the equation for $t$.{{% /answer %}}

We know that if your blood mercury level is initially at 15 $\mu$/L, then the mercury concentration can be modeled by the function $f(t)=15e^{-0.0138  \thinspace t}$ where $t$ is time in days.  

To find out how long it will take to reach a safe level of 5.8 $\mu$g/L, we need to find $t$ so that $f(t)=5.8$.

\[
  \begin{align}
  5.8 &=  15e^{-0.0138 \thinspace  t} \newline
\frac{5.8}{15}  &=  e^{-0.0138 \thinspace  t} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $15$ to isolate the exponential.}} \newline
\ln\left(\frac{5.8}{15}\right)  &=  \ln\left(e^{-0.0138 t}\right) && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Apply the natural log $\ln$ to both sides.}} \newline
\ln\left(\frac{5.8}{15}\right)  &=  -0.0138 t && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use the inverse relationship $\ln(e^{x})=x$.}} \newline
\frac{\ln\left(\frac{5.8}{15}\right)}{-0.0138}  &=  t && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $-0.0138$.}} \newline
t  &\approx  68.85 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Decimal approximation.}}
\end{align}
\]

It appears that it will take roughly 69 days for the blood mercury concentration to return to a safe level.

1.  How would this process have changed if you were asked to find the biological half-life of mercury in the blood stream?
{{% answer %}}To find the half-life we would need to solve for $t$ with $f(t)=\frac{1}{2} a$ where $a$ is the initial concentration.  The solving steps would be nearly identical to what was done above.{{% /answer %}}

### Biological Half-Life

It is very common to use the half-life model $f(x)=a\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x/c}$ to describe the biological decay of substances in the body.  To change our continuous decay model for mercury into a half-life model, we must find $t$ so that $f(t)=\frac{1}{2}  a$, where $a$ is the initial concentration.

\[
  \begin{align}
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 15  &=  15 e^{-0.0138 t} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Start with continuous decay model from above.}} \newline
\frac{1}{2}  &=  e^{-0.0138 t} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $15$ to isolate the exponential.}} \newline
\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &= \ln(e^{-0.0138 t}) && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Apply the natural log $\ln$ to both sides.}} \newline
\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &= -0.0138 t && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use the inverse relationship $\ln(e^{x})=x$.}} \newline
\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{-0.0138} &= t && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Divide both sides by $-0.0138$.}} \newline
t  &\approx  50.23 && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Use a calculator to find a decimal approximation.}}
\end{align}
\]

This shows that the half-life of mercury in the body is about 50 days.  By taking $c=50$, we conclude that the function

\[
  f(x)=15\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x/50}
\]

is the half-life model for mercury concentration that is equivalent to our earlier continuous decay model.  Both both produce the same values, they are just written in different formats.


## Looking Ahead
In the two sections that follow, we will use transformations and/or technology to find models that fit larger sets of data, but the basic process will be the same as what we've done here. 

We will always start by comparing the properties of the data with the behaviors of functions we know so that we can choose an appropriate function model that can be used to predict unknown values.

If the model predicts unreasonable values that do not make any sense, then we should try to explain how we know the result is an error and why it might have occurred.  An analysis of the errors can often lead to the construction of a more robust model.

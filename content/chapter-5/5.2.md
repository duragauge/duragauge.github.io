## Introduction
During the 1500's Italian mathematicians held public contests as a way to gain notoriety and supplement their income.  Since anyone could be challenged at any time, most mathematicians kept their discoveries secret.

Antonio Fior was an inexperienced mathematician who learned a secret for solving one type of cubic equation from his dying master.  Anxious to make a name for himself, Fior traveled to Venice and challenged Niccol√≤ Tartaglia, one of the most gifted mathematicians of the day, to solve 30 cubic equations.

Working day and night, Tartagia found what no one though possible: a general process for solving all cubic equations, not just the ones Fior had asked.

With this new technique Tartaglia solved all of Fior's problems in 2 hours and easily won the contest.  But what cemented Tartaglia's place in history is that his solution involved square roots of negative values, what we now call *imaginary numbers*.


## Imaginary Numbers
Before Tartaglia imaginary numbers had been ignored simply because they had no obvious connection to geometry; they just weren't useful for measuring anything.  For instance, an irrational real number like $\sqrt{2}$ can be viewed as the length of the diagonal of a unit square, but no part of a square corresponds to the imaginary number $\sqrt{-2}$.  

But Tartaglia's method required square roots of negative numbers, even in some cases where all the solutions turned out to be real numbers.  This forced mathematicians to develop rules for working with and visualizing these new numbers, a process that took hundres of years.{{% sidenote "Cardano" %}}Gerolamo Cardano, who published Tartaglia's methods in 1545, wrote that working with imaginary numbers involved "mental tortures." {{% /sidenote %}}

It was the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler (1707-1783) who introduced the notation $i=\sqrt{-1}$ that we use today.  The imaginary unit $i$ has the special property that $i^2=-1$.   

Any multiple of $i$ is an **imaginary number**.  For instance $2.5i$ and $-18i$ are both imaginary numbers.  

The square root of a negative number is always an imaginary number and can be rewritten as

\[\sqrt{-x} = \sqrt{x} \thinspace i\]

For example, $\sqrt{-9 \}$ and $\sqrt{-5 \}$ are the imaginary numbers $3 i$ and $\sqrt{5}\,i$.

1.  Is $\sqrt{7}$ an imaginary number? {{% answer %}}No, $\sqrt{7}$ is an irrational real number.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}


## Complex Numbers
By combining the real numbers with the imaginary numbers we can construct an even larger set called the **complex numbers**.  Every complex number can be written as

\[z=\color{red}{a}+\color{blue}{b} i\]

where $\color{red}{a}$ is the real part and $\color{blue}{b}$ is the imaginary part.  This set includes numbers like   $\color{red}{3}\color{blue}{-2}i$ and $\color{red}{1}+\color{blue}{6}i$.

Any real number can be expressed in complex form, as can every purely imaginary number.  For instance, the real number $5$ can be written in complex form as $\color{red}{5}+\color{blue}{0}i$ where the imaginary part is $\color{blue}{0}$.  And the purely imaginary number $\color{blue}{4}i$ can be written as $\color{red}{0} + \color{blue}{4}i$ where the real part is $\color{red}{0}$.

## Visualizing Complex Numbers
Since each complex number $z=a+b i$ has two parts, a real part $a$ and an imaginary part $b$, it is natural to identify it with the point $(a, b)$.  

By using the horizontal axis for the real part and the vertical for the imaginary part, we change the standard x-y pane into the **complex plane**.  Every complex number matches up with a point in the complex plane, and every point corresponds to a complex number.

As an example, the complex number $-2+i$ is represented by the point $(-2, 1)$.

## Graph Complex Valued Functions
Complex valued functions can also be graphed on a complex plane.  One way to do this is to draw an arrow between an input $z$ and its output $f(z)$.

Suppose, for example, that $f(z)=z^2-1$.  If we choose $z = -2 + i$ as our input, then we have
\[ \begin{align}
f(-2 + i) &= (-2 + i)^2-1 \newline
&= (-2 + i)(-2 + i)-1 && \text{since } (-2 + i)^2 = (-2 + i)(-2 + i) \newline
&= (4-2i-2i+i^2)-1 && \text{expanding } (-2 + i)(-2 + i) \newline
&= (4-2i-2i-1)-1 && \text{because } i^2 = -1 \newline
&= (3-4i)-1 && \text{combine like terms} \newline
&= 2-4i && \text{simplify}
\end{align}
\]
as the output value.  This particular input-output pair is shown in the interactive figure below.

The main disadvantage of this technique is that it only shows one input-output pair at a time, which makes it difficult to understand exactly what the whole function is doing.

## Domain Coloring
Another way to visualize complex valued functions was developed in the 1990's and it allows us to see the entire function.  Rather than drawing an arrow to show what happens to a particular point, this method uses colors.  

The goal is to give each complex number its own color.  To do this we cover the complex plane with a color map{{% sidenote "color map"%}}The color map we will use looks like this ![color map](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_map.png){{% /sidenote %}} that spans the whole spectrum of colors.  A point is lighter if it is closer to the origin and darker if it is farther away, with the origin itself $(0, 0)$ being bright white.

With this method we visualize the function by coloring $z$ based on where $f(z)$ is on the color map.  

For instance, we calculated earlier that if $f(z)=z^2-1$, then $f(-2+i)=2-4i$.  Since the color map puts $2 - 4i$ in the purple region, we color our original point **$\color{#9C0973}{-2 + i}$** purple.

If we combine this idea with the earlier arrow diagram, then the arrow will point to the color that should be used for $z$.  

<iframe scrolling="no" title="Complex Plot Color & Arrow" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/HMI6jSd0/width/365/height/420/border/fafafa/sfsb/false/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false" width="365px" height="420px" style="border:0px;"> </iframe>

{{% /check %}}


If we keep track of the color of each point then the entire domain can be colored, giving us a more complete picture of the function.  

These graphs are called **domain coloring graphs** of a complex function, and look very different from the graphs you are used to drawing by hand or creating on a graphing calculator.  

Since creating a domain coloring graph requires a computer graphics program, you will not be expected to make them on your own.  But we will use them in this section to discover some useful facts about polynomials.

## Identify Real and Imaginary Zeros
Domain coloring graphs are especially helpful in identifying the zeros of functions like polynomials.  Since you will be required to identify zeros from a domain coloring graph, we should review the definition of a zero.

Remember that a number $c$ is a zero of a function if $f(c)=0$.  If $c$ is a real number then we call it a **real zero** of the function.   

Imaginary numbers can also be zeros of a function.  If $c$ is an imaginary number and $f(c)=0$, then it is an **imaginary zero** of the function.

{{% check %}}
The solutions to $z^{3}+z^2+z+1=0$ are $z=-1,$ $z=i$ and $z=-i$.

1. Which of the zeros above is an imaginary zero?
{{% answer %}}The imaginary zeros are $z=i$ and $z=-i$.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}


The key to identifying zeros visually from a domain coloring graph is to realize that the number $0$ corresponds to the origin $(0, 0)$ in the complex plane.

Since the origin in our color map is a white point at the center of all the colors, the zeros of a function will have a similar appearance.  In other words, we can find the zeros by looking for bright white points surrounded by all the colors.

Take a look at this domain coloring graph of the function $f(z)=z^2-1$, which is a higher-resolution copy of the graph you made a moment ago.  

![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_Z_squared_minus_1.png#center)

There are two bright white points, one at $(-1, 0)$ and another at $(1, 0)$, corresponding to the complex numbers $-1+0i=-1$ and $1+0i=1$.  This means that the function $f(z)=z^2-1$ has real zeros of $-1$ and $1$.  Real zeros, such as these, will always be found along the real axis of a domain coloring graph.

Imaginary zeros also show up on domain coloring graphs as bright white points.  For instance, in this graph of $f(z)=z^2-4z+5$, the points $(2, 1)$ and $(2, -1)$ are bright white points where all the colors meet.  

![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_z2-4z+5.png#center)

That means the zeros are the imaginary numbers $2+i$ and $2-i$.

1.  Use this domain coloring graph to find the zeros of $f(z)=z^2+1$.  
{{% answer %}}Since the white points are at $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$, the zeros must be $i$ and $-i$.{{% /answer %}}   
{{% /check %}}


It's possible for a function to have a mixture of real zeros and imaginary zeros.  In an earlier Quick Check we saw that the zeros of  $f(z)=z^{3}+z^2+z+1$ are $z=-1,$ $z=i$ and $z=-i$.  These three zeros are visible in the domain coloring graph as the points are $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 1)$ and $(0,-1)$.

![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_v_standard.png#center)

However, if we plot the equivalent polynomial $p(x)=x^{3}+x^{2}+x+1$ on a standard graph, only the real zero (x-intercept) at $x-1$ is visible.  Imaginary zeros are never visible on standard real-valued graphs.


## The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
With a domain coloring graph we can easily count the number of real and imaginary zeros of a function.  Remember, if the zero is on the real axis, then it is a real zero.  If it is anywhere else, it is imaginary.

{{% check %}}
For each domain coloring graph below, determine the number of real zeros and the number of imaginary zeros.

1. &nbsp; ![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_FTA_1.png#center)
{{% answer %}}There is only 1 zero.  Since it is on the real axis, it is a real zero.{{% /answer %}}
1. &nbsp; ![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_FTA_2.png#center) {{% answer %}}There are 2 zeros.  Since they are not on the real axis, they must both be imaginary zeros.{{% /answer %}}

{{% /check %}}


You may not have realized it, but each of the functions in the previous Quick Check was a polynomial.  Since we are interested in understanding polynomials, let's look at those same graphs again.  This time, pay attention to the degree of the polynomial as well the number of zeros.

{{% check %}}
For each domain coloring graph below, determine the number of real zeros and the number of imaginary zeros. Also give the degree of the polynomial.

1. &nbsp; ![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_FTA_1.png#center)

1. &nbsp; ![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_FTA_2.png#center) {{% answer %}}0 real zeros and 2 imaginary zeros.  The degree is 2.{{% /answer %}}
1. &nbsp; ![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_FTA_3.png#center) {{% answer %}}1 real zero and 2 imaginary zeros.  The degree is 3.{{% /answer %}}
1. &nbsp; ![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_FTA_4.png#center) {{% answer %}}2 real zeros and 2 imaginary zeros.  The degree is 4.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}


After looking at those graphs a second time you might have noticed a connection between the zeros and the degree of the polynomial.  The number of real zeros plus the number of imaginary zeros equals the degree of the polynomial exactly.  This is a consequence of the **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**, which was proven by the 20-year-old Carl Friedrich Gauss in his doctoral dissertation of 1799.  We will hear more about Gauss in the next chapter.

While the proof is very complicated and beyond the scope of this text, what the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says is actually very simple.  In essence, Gauss showed that a polynomial whose degree is $n$ will always have exactly $n$ zeros.  Some of the zeros might be imaginary, some may be repeated, but it will always have $n$ zeros total.

For instance, since  $p(x)=2x^4-3x+8$ is a $4th$ degree polynomial, we know from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that it has exactly $4$ zeros.

{{% check %}}
1. How many total zeros does $p(x)=-3x^6+x^{2}-9x$ have?

1. How many total zeros does $p(x)=5x^{3}-4$ have?
{{% answer %}}It is a 3rd degree polynomial, so it must have 3 zeros.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}


## Determine the Number of Real & Imaginary Zeros
We will use the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to help us identify the number of real and imaginary zeros of a polynomial when a domain coloring graph is unavailable.

Consider, for instance, the polynomial $p(x)=x^5+1$ whose graph is given below.

![](/img/chapter-5/poly_turns_6.svg#center)

We can see from the graph that it has just one real zero, corresponding to the x-intercept at $x=-1$.  Since it is a 5th degree polynomial, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tells us that it must have 5 zeros total, so the remaining 4 zeros must be imaginary.

{{% /check %}}


## Conjugate Zeros Theorem
You may have noticed a curious fact about the number of imaginary zeros.  In every example we've looked at so far, the number of imaginary zeros has always been even, and there's a very good reason for that.

The **conjugate zeros theorem** says that if the coefficients of your polynomial are real numbers, and $a+bi$ is a zero, then its *conjugate* $a-bi$ is also a zero.  In other words, imaginary zeros always come in pairs, which means there must always a even number of them.

You can see the conjugate pairs in a domain coloring graph.  For instance, look at the domain coloring graph of $f(z)=z^2-4z+5$.

![](/img/chapter-5/domain_coloring_z2-4z+5.png#center)

There are two imaginary zeros, $2+i$ and $2-i$, corresponding to the points $(2, 1)$ and $(2, -1)$ on the graph.  As expected, these two imaginary zeros are conjugates.  The only difference between them is that one has a positive imaginary part while the imaginary part of the other is negative.

1. Is it possible for a polynomial with real valued coefficients to have exactly one imaginary zero?
{{% answer %}}No, the conjugate zeros theorem says they only come in pairs.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}


## Multiple Zeros
When using the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to count the number of real and imaginary zeros of a polynomial, we must be mindful of multiple zeros.

For instance, when looking at the graph of $p(x)=x^4-3x^{2}$

![](/img/chapter-5/FTA_4b.png#center)

it would be easy to mistakenly say that since it has $3$ x-intercepts, it must have $3$ real zeros and only $1$ imaginary zero.  Clearly this cannot be the case; the conjugate zeros theorem tells us that having only $1$ imaginary zero is impossible.

Taking another look at the graph we notice that the real zero at $x=0$ has a multiplicity of $2$, since it touches the x-axis and bounces off.  This means that $p(x)=x^4-3x^{2}$ actually has $4$ real zeros and $0$ imaginary zeros.

{{% check %}}

{{% answer %}}It is a 5th degree polynomial.  It has x-intercepts (real zeros) at $x=-1$, $x=0$ and $x=1$. The zeros at $x=-1$ and $x=1$ both have a multiplicity of $2$ since they bounce off the x-axis like a parabola.  This means there are $5$ real zeros total and none that are imaginary.{{% /answer %}}
1. &nbsp; ![](/img/chapter-5/poly_graph_real_imaginary_zeros_1.png#center)
{{% answer %}}This is a 6th degree polynomial, so there must be $6$ zeros total.  We can see $4$ real zeros (two each at $x=-2$ and $x=2$) which leaves $2$ more zeros that must be imaginary and cannot be seen on the graph.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}


## Looking Ahead
After Tartaglia's work, a method was quickly found for finding all 4 zeros of any 4th degree polynomial by Cardano's assistant, Ferrari.  Mathematicians all over the world felt that it was just a mater of time before they would have formulas for not only any 5th degree polynomial, but for every polynomial.  In the next section we will see the end result of their efforts.

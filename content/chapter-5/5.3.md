## Introduction
As the smoke cleared on the morning of May 30, 1832, young Évariste Galois lay mortally wounded on the ground, having been shot in the stomach.  Though only 20 years old, Galois had earned a reputation not only as a brilliant mathematician, but also as a reckless political activist who had threatened the life of the French king and been arrested for carrying loaded weapons during a protest in Paris.  

No one knows for sure why Galois was involved the duel.  Some say that he was defending the honor of a young lady or that he was the victim of a government conspiracy.  All we know is that he feared for his life and spent the night before the duel writing farewell letters to close friends.

In one of those letters Galois famously described a new mathematical theory that revealed the hidden framework of polynomials.


## Galios Theory
What Galois had discovered was a way to link polynomials with mathematical structures called "groups".  What's more, Galois showed that the symmetries and patterns in these groups were related to the zeros of polynomials.

Galois's theory, together with the work of his equally tragic contemporary Niels Henrik Abel{{% sidenote "Abel"%}}Abel was a young Norwegian mathematician struggling to find steady income so he could marry his fiancée.  He died at the age of 26 from tuberculosis.  Two days later a letter arrived offering a post at the University of Berlin.{{% /sidenote %}}, showed that it is impossible to find a general algebraic formula (ie. a formula involving only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers and roots) for the zeros of a polynomial if the degree is higher than 4.

In other words, we cannot count on using a formula to find the zeros of a polynomial if its degree is higher than 4.  In fact, since the formulas for the [cubic](/img/chapter-5/cubic_formula.svg) and [quartic](/img/chapter-5/quartic_formula.svg) are impractical, the only polynomial formula you'll likely need to remember is the [quadratic formula](/img/chapter-5/quadratic_formula.svg).

Instead of using complicated formulas, we will use a combination of graphical, algebraic, and numerical methods to find the zeros of polynomials.  And since graphs help us estimate the number and location of any real zeros as well as the number of imaginary zeros, it is preferable to study the graph of a polynomial first.


## Verifying Zeros
You'll recall that the real zeros of a polynomial are real numbers that are solutions to the equation $p(x)=0$.  Graphically they correspond to the x-intercepts of its graph.

For instance, the graph of $p(x)=x^5-5x^{3}+4x$, shown here, appears to have x-intercepts at $x=-2$, $x=-1$, $x=0$, $x=1$ and $x=2$.

![](/img/chapter-5/poly_graph_5_integer_zeros.svg#center)

But how do we know if these really are the zeros?  Maybe the true values are slightly different.  To verify that those values really are zeros we must check to see if $p(x)=0$ for each one.  With $x=-2$, for example,

\[ \begin{align}
p(-2) &= (-2)^5-5(-2)^3+4(-2) \newline
&=-32+40-8 \newline
&=0
\end{align}
\]

so we can be confident that $x=-2$ truly is a zero.

## The Rational Zeros Theorem
With many polynomials it is difficult to determine the exact location of the real zeros from a graph alone.

Consider the cubic polynomial $p(x)=3x^{3}+8x^{2}+3x-2$.  

![](/img/chapter-5/poly_graph_1_rational_2_integer_zeros.svg#center)

From the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra we know that this has exactly three zeros, and $x=-2$ and $x=-1$ appear to be two of them.  

But the location of third zero is not clear.  It might be $\frac{1}{4}$ or $\frac{1}{3}$ or maybe it's some irrational number like $\sqrt{\frac{1}{8}}$.  We simply can't tell just by looking. Luckily, there are a couple of new tools that can help.

The first new tool is the **rational zeros theorem**.  The rational zeros theorem comes from a nice pattern that occurs if the zeros of a polynomial happen to be fractions.  Inspect the table below and see if you can spot a pattern.

![](/img/chapter-5/rational_zeros_table.svg#center)

Notice that the *<font color="red">numerators</font>* of each zero are factors of the *<font color="red">constant term</font>* and the *<font color="blue">denominators</font>* are factors of the *<font color="blue">leading coefficient</font>*.  If a polynomial with integer coefficients has a rational zero, then this pattern will always occur.

In other words, if all the coefficients of a polynomial are integers, then there are a limited number of rational numbers that can be zeros and they must all follow the pattern above, with *<font color="red">numerators</font>*  coming from the *<font color="red">constant term</font>* and *<font color="blue">denominators</font>* from the *<font color="blue">leading coefficient</font>*.

## Finding Rational Zeros of a Polynomial

### Rational Zeros Example 1
Let's return to the polynomial  $p(x)=\color{blue}{3}x^{3}+8x^{2}+3x\color{red}{-2}$ and see how the rational zeros theorem helps us identify its zeros.  Since the leading coefficient is $\color{blue}{3}$ and the constant term is $\color{red}{-2}$, we know that the numerators and denominators of possible rational zeros must be

![](/img/chapter-5/rational_zeros_1_num_den.png#center)

This means that all rational zeros of $p(x)=\color{blue}{3}x^{3}+8x^{2}+3x\color{red}{-2}$  can be found in the following list.

![](/img/chapter-5/rational_zeros_1.png#center)

We can see from the graph that $-1$ and $-2$ are zeros, and both appear in this list.  

![](/img/chapter-5/poly_graph_1_rational_2_integer_zeros_color.svg#center)

Judging from the graph, if the third zero is a rational number then it is either $\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}$ or $\frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{3}}$.  

To see if either of these are the zeros we put the into the function and see if the result is zero.  We'll start with $\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}$.

\[
\begin{align}
p\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right)&=3\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right)^{3}+8\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right)^2+3\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right)-2 \newline
&=3\left(\frac{1}{27}\right)+8\left(\frac{1}{9}\right)+1-2 \newline
&= \frac{3}{27}+\frac{8}{9}-1 \newline
&= \frac{1}{9} + \frac{8}{9}-1 \newline
&= \frac{9}{9} - 1 \newline
&= 1 - 1 \newline
&= 0
\end{align}
\]

Since $p\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right)=0$ we know that $\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}$ is the third zero of the polynomial.  There's no need to check $\frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{3}}$ because this polynomial only has three zeros.

### Rational Zeros Example 2
Let's use a graph and the rational zeros theorem to see if $p(x)=\color{blue}{6}x^2+7x\color{red}{-5}$ has any rational zeros.  

With a leading coefficient of $\color{blue}{6}$ and a constant term of $\color{red}{-5}$, we know that all rational zeros, if there are any, must be in the following list.

![](/img/chapter-5//rational_zeros_3.png#center)

With the help of the graph we can narrow this list down to $\frac{ \color{red}{1} } { \color{blue}{2} }$, $\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}$ and $\frac{\color{red}{-5}}{\color{blue}{3}}$, since the other values are not near the x-intercepts.

![](/img/chapter-5/poly_graph_2_rational_zeros_color.svg#center)

Now we need to check each one, beginning with $x=\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{2}}$.

\[ \begin{align}
p\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{2}}\right) &= 6\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{2}}\right)^2+7\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{2}}\right)-5 \newline
&=\frac{6}{4}+\frac{7}{2}-5 \newline
&=0
\end{align}
\]

We've found one zero!  Let's keep going and check $x=\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}$.

\[ \begin{align}
p\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right) &= 6\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right)^2+7\left(\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right)-5 \newline
&=\frac{6}{9}+\frac{7}{3}-5 \newline
&=2
\end{align}
\]

Since this is not $0$, we move on to our last option, $x=\frac{\color{red}{-5}}{\color{blue}{3}}$.

\[ \begin{align}
p\left(\frac{\color{red}{-5}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right) &= 6\left(\frac{\color{red}{-5}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right)^2+7\left(\frac{\color{red}{-5}}{\color{blue}{3}}\right)-5 \newline
&=\frac{150}{9}-\frac{35}{3}-5 \newline
&=0
\end{align}
\]

From this it's clear that $\frac{ \color{red}{1} } { \color{blue}{2} }$ and $\frac{\color{red}{-5}}{\color{blue}{3}}$ are both zeros of our polynomial.  And since the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says that a second degree polynomial has exactly two zeros, we know we have found all of the solutions.

## Finding Real Zeros of a Polynomial

### Real Zeros Example 1
There are two other tools we have at our disposal that we shouldn't forget about.  For example, the possible rational zeros of $p(x)=\color{blue}{1}x^2-\color{red}{3}$ are

$$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{1}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{1}} $$

but the graph does not have x-intercepts at $\pm 1$ or at $\pm 3$.

![](/img/chapter-5/poly_graph_2_irrational.svg#center)

It's important remember that the Rational Zeros Theorem only gives us a list of rational numbers that *might* be zeros.  If none of them work then the zeros are not fractions.  

In this case the two zeros are irrational numbers and can be found with the Quadratic Formula.

\[
\begin{align}
x &= \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \newline
&= \frac{-(0)\pm\sqrt{(0)^2-4(\color{blue}{1})(\color{red}{3})}}{2\color{blue}{(1)}} \newline
&= \frac{\pm\sqrt{12}}{2} \newline
&= \frac{\pm2\sqrt{3}}{2} \newline
&= \pm \sqrt{3} \newline
\end{align}
\]

So the first tool we shouldn't forget about is the Quadratic Formula.

### Real Zeros Example 2
The second tool that is often helpful is synthetic division.  Consider, for instance the polynomial $p(x)=\color{blue}{6}x^3+7x^2-16x\color{red}{-12}$.  The list of possible rational zeros is huge.

$$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{1}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace  \pm \frac{\color{red}{4}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace\pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{12}}{\color{blue}{1}} $$

$$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{2}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{2}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{2}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{4}}{\color{blue}{2}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{2}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{12}}{\color{blue}{2}} $$

$$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{3}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{3}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{4}}{\color{blue}{3}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{3}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{12}}{\color{blue}{3}} $$

$$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{6}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{6}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{6}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{4}}{\color{blue}{6}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{6}}{\color{blue}{6}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{12}}{\color{blue}{6}} $$

By eliminating duplicate values like $\frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{1}}$ and $\frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{2}}$ and looking at the graph

![](/img/chapter-5/poly_graph_1_integer_2_rational.svg#center)

we can trim this list down significantly, but there are still five numbers to check (listed here in numerical order).

$$\frac{\color{red}{-2}}{\color{blue}{1}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{-2}}{\color{blue}{3}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{-1}}{\color{blue}{2}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{-1}}{\color{blue}{3}}, \thinspace \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{2}}$$

Earlier we plugged the values into the polynomial to check each one.  While that always works, synthetic division can also be used.  To show how this works we'll pick $\frac{\color{red}{-2}}{\color{blue}{1}}=-2$ out of our list and do synthetic division.  

![](/img/chapter-5/synthetic_2_a.svg#center)

Since the remainder is $0$ we know that $\left(x-\frac{\color{red}{-2}}{\color{blue}{1}}\right)$ is a factor of the polynomial, which also means that $\frac{\color{red}{-2}}{\color{blue}{1}}$ is a zero.

Anytime we do synthetic division and end with a remainder of $0$ then we have found a zero of the polynomial.

Additionally, any other real zeros must be inside the quotient $6x^2-5x-6$ and could be found by the quadratic formula.  But since our list of rational zeros was so small, it may be preferable to check the remaining three numbers by synthetic division before resorting to the quadratic formula.  

Starting with $\frac{\color{red}{-2}}{\color{blue}{3}}$, the synthetic division tells us that it is a zero.

![](/img/chapter-5/synthetic_2_b.svg#center)

Since $\frac{\color{red}{-2}}{\color{blue}{3}}$ is a zero, there's no need to check $\frac{\color{red}{-1}}{\color{blue}{2}}$ and $\frac{\color{red}{-1}}{\color{blue}{3}}$, but we should still look at $\frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{2}}$.

![](/img/chapter-5/synthetic_2_c.svg#center)

We conclude that the three zeros of our polynomial are $-2$, $\thinspace \frac{\color{red}{-2}}{\color{blue}{3}} \thinspace$ and $\thinspace \frac{\color{red}{3}}{\color{blue}{2}}$.


## Finding Complex Zeros of a Polynomial

### Complex Zeros Example 1
The process we have developed can also find imaginary zeros.  This time we'll examine $p(x)=\color{blue}{3} x^{3}-14 x^{2}+23 x\color{red}{-10}$.  

This is a third degree polynomial so it must have three zeros.  We can tell right away from the graph that it only has one real zero, so there must be two that are imaginary.

![](/img/chapter-5/poly_graph_1_rational_2_imaginary.svg#center)

If that real zero is a rational number, then we can find it using the Rational Zeros Theorem by examining the list of fractions that might be zeros.

$$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{1}}, \thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{5}}{\color{blue}{1}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{10}}{\color{blue}{1}}$$

$$\pm \frac{\color{red}{1}}{\color{blue}{3}}, \thinspace \pm ,\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{5}}{\color{blue}{3}},\thinspace \pm \frac{\color{red}{10}}{\color{blue}{3}}$$

Out of that list $\frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{3}}$ appears to be out best choice, so we'll use synthetic division to check it.

![](/img/chapter-5/synthetic_3.svg#center)

Because the remainder is $0$ we know for sure that $\frac{\color{red}{2}}{\color{blue}{3}}$ is a zero.  

That takes care of our one real zero, but what about the two that are imaginary?  Those are inside the quotient $3x^{2}-12x+15$ and we'll get them with the quadratic formula.

\[
\begin{align}
x &= \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \newline
&= \frac{-(-12)\pm\sqrt{(-12)^2-4(3)(15)}}{2(3)} \newline
&= \frac{12 \pm\sqrt{-36}}{6} \newline
&= \frac{12 \pm 6i}{6} \newline
&= 2 \pm i \newline
\end{align}
\]

The two imaginary zeros are $2+i$ and $2-i$ and we have now found all three of the complex zeros of our polynomial.

### Complex Zeros Example 2
Our final example $p(x)=x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -2$ is a fourth degree polynomial with a very short list of possible rational zeros.  The choices are $\pm 1$ and $\pm 2$ and a graph quickly shows us that $-2$ and $1$ are the likely candidates.

![](/img/chapter-5/poly_graph_2_integer_2_imaginary.svg#center)

As before we'll check one of these by synthetic division, starting with $-2$.

![](/img/chapter-5/synthetic_4_a.svg#center)

This tells us that $-2$ is a zero, but we still have three more to find.  The key is to remember that all the other zeros must be in the quotient $x^3-x^2+x-1$.  So now we focus on the quotient and repeat the process.

If $x^3-x^2+x-1$ has a rational zero then it is in our original list, so let's try $1$.

![](/img/chapter-5/synthetic_4_b.svg#center)

Since the remainder is zero, we know $1$ is a zero of the polynomial.  The final two zeros must be inside this new quotient $x^2+1$ and we'll use the quadratic formula to get them out.

\[
\begin{align}
x &= \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \newline
&= \frac{-(0)\pm\sqrt{(0)^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} \newline
&= \frac{\pm\sqrt{-4}}{2} \newline
&= \frac{\pm 2i}{2} \newline
&= \pm i \newline
\end{align}
\]

We add these two imaginary numbers to our list and can finally say that the four complex zeros of $p(x)=x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -2$ are $-2, \thinspace 1, \thinspace, -i \thinspace$ and $\thinspace i$.


## Summary
Let's take a moment to summarize the process that we have developed.  Given a polynomial, we can attempt to find its complex (real and imaginary) zeros by working through the following steps.

1. Use the Rational Zeros Theorem to list all possible fractions that might be zeros.  
1. Trim down that list by looking at a graph and eliminating any values that are not reasonably close to the x-intercepts.
1. Check the remaining values either by testing if $p(x)=0$ or by performing synthetic division and seeing if the remainder is zero.
1. Repeat the process for the other zeros or, if the quotient is a 2nd degree polynomial, apply the quadratic formula.

## Looking Ahead
While the process outlined here will work for all the exercises in the homework, it is far from being a universal method that will work for every polynomial.  For most problems, in fact, it is not possible to find exact zeros, so we have to find approximations.  There is even an entire field of modern math (numerical analysis) dedicated to, among other things, constructing algorithms for finding zeros of equations.  And many practical applications in physics, chemistry, engineering, etc. rely on those computational methods.

In the next section we get a brief glimpse of a few ways polynomials end up being used in the real world.

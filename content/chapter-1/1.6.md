## Introduction
When the stock market opened on Monday, October 22, 2001, stock in Enron (a large Fortune-500 energy company) was trading for about $20 per share.  

At the same time stock in Apple (the electronics manufacturer) could also be purchased for $20.

Without additional information, it would be natural to assume that state of both companies was the same.  In reality, however, they were headed in opposite directions.

Later that day, the SEC announced they were investigating Enron for accounting irregularities.  Within weeks the company declared bankruptcy and several Enron executives were sent to prison for fraud and conspiracy.

Apple, on the other hand, had an important announcement of their own.  The next day, on October 23, 2001, Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the very first iPod.  It was an iconic success that revolutionized the consumer electronics industry and helped establish Apple as one of the most innovative technology companies in the world.

As we've seen earlier, functions, just like stocks, can increase and decrease in value. Our goal in this section is to develop tools that allow us to measure, compare and categorize functions based on how they change.



## Intervals
In this section we will look at how much a function changes ([total change](#total-change)), how large that change is relative to the starting value ([percent change](#percent-change)), and how quickly that change happens ([average rate of change](#average-rate-of-change)).

But before we can do any of those calculations we have to specify which [interval](../1.1#intervals-of-real-numbers) we are inspecting.  It's important to note that these intervals are subsets of the domain, so they are x-values.  For instance, the interval $[5,9]$ is all real numbers from $x=5$ to $x=9$.

In addition to identifying a specific interval, we might also need to measure how long it is.  The length of an interval from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is given by

| \[\Delta x = b-a\] |
| --- |

The Greek leter "delta" ($\Delta$) is used throughout math and science to indicate change.  So writing $\Delta x$ means "the change in the x-values" and is the length of the interval $[a, b]$.

{{% /check %}}


## Total Change
The amount that a function has increased or decreased on an interval is called the **total change** on that interval.  Since this is the change in the y-values, we will often use the shorthand notation $\Delta y$ to represent total change.

To calculate the total change of a function on an interval $[a, b]$ we simply subtract the starting value $f(a)$ from the ending value $f(b)$.

| \[\Delta y = f(b)-f(a)\] |
| --- |

Notice that the total change does not care about what happens in the middle of the interval, it is only the starting and ending values that matter.

Both $\Delta y$ and $\Delta x$ are illustrated in the diagram below.

## Percent Change
Suppose you're planning a vacation to Hawaii and find that the price of airplane tickets has increased from $\\$400$ to $\\$410$.  While you might be a bit annoyed, a $\\$10$ increase is unlikely to make you cancel your trip.

However, if your favorite café raised the price of a cup of coffee from $\\$4$ to $\\$14$, that $\\$10$ increase would almost certainly make you reconsider visiting that café ever again.

These two situations feel so different, even though the total increase is $\\$10$ in both cases, because total change doesn't look at the increase in cost relative to the starting price.

To measure the relative change all we need to do is divide the total change by the original value.  This is often called **percent change** and is given by 

|  \[\text{percent change} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{f(a)} \] |
| --- |

This formula gives us a decimal which we then interpret as a percentage.  A value such as $0.12$, for instance, should be taken to mean $12\\%$. Additionally, negative values are typically labeled as "decreasing" percentages, so that a value like $-0.08$ would be written as a $8\\% \text{decrease}$.

In the case of the airplane tickets, the total change is $\\$10$ and the original price is $\\$400$, so the percent change is $\frac{\\$10}{\\$400}=0.025$ or $2.5\\%$.

On the other hand, the percent change for the coffee is $\frac{\\$10}{\\$4}=2.5$ which is a relative increase of $250\\%$.

As these examples illustrate, percent change can vary significantly even when the total change is the same. This is why relative change is a useful measure in many real-world scenarios.

## Average Rate of Change
While percent change helps you see the relative increase or decrease in values, it does not indicate how quickly the change is happening.  

If we think back to our coffee example, imagine if the price increased from $\\$4$ to $\\$14$ over a period of $10$ years rather than overnight, that would be a much less dramatic change.

To see measure how rapidly a function change we need to average the total change over the length of the interval.  

You are probably already familiar with the basic process of finding averages.  For instance, if you drove a distance of 100 miles in 2 hours then your average speed would be $\frac{100 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}$. Your actual speed may have varied during the trip but, on average, it was 50 miles per hour.

Similarly, to find the average change of a function, we divide the total change in the function values $\Delta y$ by the corresponding change $\Delta x$ in the input values.

|  \[ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}  = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\]   |
| --- |

Since $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is a ratio, it is called the **average *rate* of change** of a function.  This value describes what will happen to $f(x)$, on average, every time $x$ increases by $1$.

To see how this works let's find the average rate of change of $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ on the interval $[9, 100]$.  Using the formula above:

\[ \begin{align}
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} &= \frac{\sqrt{100} - \sqrt{9}} {100 - 9} \newline
&= \frac{10-3}{91} \newline
&= \frac{7}{91} \newline
&\approx 0.077
\end{align}\]  

This tells us that from $x=9$ to $x=100$ the function $f(x)=\sqrt x$ increases, on average, by $0.077$ units every time $x$ increases by $1$ unit.

It's useful to know that that unless a function is linear, the average rate of change will vary depending on the interval $[a, b]$ chosen.

## Finding Average Rate of Change Graphically
If the average rate of change formula looks somewhat familiar, there's a good reason for that.  It is nothing more than the classic *slope* formula $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ converted to function notation.

The line connecting the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$ is called a secant line.

When a function is defined by a graph, the average rate of change can always be calculated by finding the slope of the secant line.

## Concavity and Rates that Change
When walking, cycling, or driving, you've no doubt sped up, slowed down or maintained a constant speed.  In other words, you've changed your rate of speed. 

Since speed itself is a rate of change, by accelerating (speeding up) or decelerating (slowing down) you are actually changing this rate of change.

Graphically, changes in rates of change are evident when a curve becomes steeper or less steep over an interval.  This connects to the concept of [concavity](../1.3#concavity) which we encountered earlier.

It's important to recognize that this is independent of whether a function is increasing or decreasing.

For instance, an increasing function could grow in three different ways: at a constant rate, at an increasing rate, or at a decreasing rate.  All three options are shown below.  

![](/img/chapter-1/increasing_3.svg#center)

Similarly, functions can decrease at constant, increasing, and decreasing rates.

![](/img/chapter-1/decreasing_3.svg#center)

While analyzing changing rate of change is a topic best studied in calculus, it's not too difficult to recognize situations where rates change or to spot the concavity of a graph.

## Difference Quotients
The formulas we have used so far show what happens on a specific interval.  Now we'll introduce a tool that allows us to examine the behavior of a function on any interval, using a more general approach.

The tool that does this is called the **difference quotient**.  The difference quotient $D(x)$ is a function that lets us calculate the average rate of change on a generic interval from $x$ to $x+h$, where $h$ is any positive number.

![](/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient.svg#center)

To see how the difference quotient comes from the average rate of change formula, we substitute $\color{red}{x}$ for $\color{red}{a}$ and $\color{blue}{x+h}$ for $\color{blue}{b}$.  

\[
\begin{align}
\frac{f(\color{blue}{b})-f(\color{red}{a})}{\color{blue}{b}-\color{red}{a}} &= \frac{f(\color{blue}{x+h})-f(\color{red}{x})}{\color{blue}{(x+h)}-\color{red}{x}} \newline \newline
          &= \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{align}
\]  

The behavior of $D(x)$ is connected to how the function $f(x)$ changes in two important ways.  First, whether the function is strictly increasing, decreasing or constant on an interval impacts the sign of $D(x)$.

* If $f(x)$ is increasing on an interval, then the difference quotient $D(x)$ is positive on that same interval.
* If $f(x)$ is decreasing on an interval, then the difference quotient $D(x)$ will be negative on that interval.
* If $f(x)$ is constant over an interval, then the difference quotient $D(x)$ is $0$ over that interval.

Secondly, the concavity of the function tells us if $D(x)$ itself is increasing, decreasing or constant.  That is to say,

* If $f(x)$ is concave up on an interval, then $D(x)$ increases over that interval.
* If $f(x)$ is concave down on an interval, then $D(x)$ decreases on that interval.
* On any interval where $f(x)$ is a straight line, $D(x)$ will be constant.

Let's examine a few simple examples.  The function $f(x)=3x+2$ is an increasing linear function, so we expect the difference quotient to be a positive constant value, and it is.

![](/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient_3x+2.svg#center)

It is interesting to note that the value of the difference quotient is exactly the same as the value of the slope of the line.

For our final example, we'll look at the square function $f(x)=x^{2}$.  We know that this function is concave up over its entire domain of all real numbers, so we expcect its difference quotient will always be increasing. 

![](/img/chapter-1/difference_quotient_x_squared.svg)

Notice that no matter what value $h$ happens to be, $D(x)$ is always increasing since it is a linear function with a slope of $2$.


## Looking Ahead
Exploring how functions change is a fascinating topic and is foundational to calculus.  Not only will calculus teach you more about efficiently computing *average* rates of change, you will also learn to use the difference quotient to calculate *instantaneous* rates change, leading to the powerful concept of a **derivative**.

But for now, it is enough to know that functions with similar behaviors have similar difference quotients, allowing us to group them together into different families that we will encounter in the next chapters.

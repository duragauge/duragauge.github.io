## Introduction
The Smithsonian in Washington, DC is one of the largest museums in the world, with vast collections of rare and historically significant objects.  

The Air and Space collection, for instance, includes pioneering firsts like the [1903 Wright Flyer](https://www.si.edu/object/nasm_A19610048000) and the [Apollo 11 Module](https://www.si.edu/object/nasm_A19700102000).  

In other collections you might find [Abraham Lincoln’s top hat](https://www.si.edu/object/nmah_1199660) or an original [Kermit the Frog](https://www.si.edu/object/nmah_765593) puppet or the [Hope Diamond](https://www.si.edu/spotlight/hope-diamond). All told, the Smithsonian has more than 200 million fossils, specimens and treasures.

These collections help preserve our nation’s history and culture, and are important to researchers and scientists.

Collections are also important in math, though you seldom find them in a museum.


## Sets
In mathematics collections are usually called **sets**.  Sets are considered to be the foundation of modern mathematics.

All you need to create a set is a way of deciding if an object is part of the collection or not.

One way to do that is to list all the elements of the set.  For instance

![the set of colors on a traffic light](/img/chapter-1/set_colors.svg#center)

is the set of colors on a traffic light.{{% sidenote "note about braces" %}}Sets are always enclosed in curly braces $\\{ \thinspace \thinspace \\}$.{{% /sidenote %}}

It can also be helpful to draw a set as a diagram.

![the set of colors on a traffic light](/img/chapter-1/set_colors_diagram.svg#center)


## Set-Builder Notation
Sometimes it's hard to list everything in a set.  For instance, $\text{whiskers on kittens}$, $\text{bright copper kettles}$ and $\text{warm woolen mittens}$ might be a few of my favorite things, but listing all my favorites would be impossible.  What we do instead is describe the set using words

$$\\{\text{my favorite things}\\}.$$

If we want to talk about a generic element of the set we include a variable like $x$ and write it as

$$\\{ x \thinspace \vert \thinspace x \text{ is one of my favorite things}\\}.$$

This last example is called **set-builder notation**.  The vertical bar symbol $\vert$ is shorthand for "such that" or "where".  If we put the set above into words we would read it as "the set of all $x$ *where* $x$ is one of my favorite things."

{{% check %}} Describe the following set in words and list a few items that are in the set:
$$

$$
{{% answer %}}This is the set of all $x$ where $x$ is something you might need in math class.  Elements in this set could include note paper, a pencil, a calculator, etc.{{% /answer %}}

## Combining Sets
Sets can be combined in two different ways. The first way is to group everything from both sets together into one big set, called the **union** of the two sets.  In the figure below you can form the union of the two sets by moving the **<font color="blue">blue</font>** slider.

{{% geogebra ratio="29.16%" id="s9wa8eba" %}}

The union of some set $A$ with another set $B$ is written using the union symbol: $\bigcup$.  Formally we say

$$A \bigcup B=\\{x \vert x \text{ is in } A  \text{ or }  x \text{ is in }B  \\}.$$

The second way to combine sets is to only consider items that the two sets have in common. This is called the **intersection** of the sets.

{{% geogebra ratio="29.16%" id="f6fbnnnc" %}}

The intersection of two sets also has its own symbol: $\bigcap$.

$$A \bigcap B=\\{x \vert x \text{ is in } A  \text{ and }  x \text{ is in }B\ \\}$$

If the intersection has nothing in it we say it is *empty* and use the symbol $\varnothing$ to represent the **empty set**.

{{% check %}} Consider the following sets
$$
\begin{align}
A &= \{\text{flour, sugar, butter, eggs, milk}\} \newline
B &= \{\text{bacon, pancakes, eggs, milk}\} \newline
C &= \{\text{peas, carrots, potatoes}\}.
\end{align}
$$

1. List everything that would be in $A\bigcup C$. {{% answer %}}Since the union is all of the items in both sets combined, $A\bigcup C$ would contain flour, sugar, butter, eggs, milk, peas, carrots, and potatoes.</br></br>{{% /answer %}}
1. List all the elements of $A\bigcap B$. {{% answer %}}Since intersection is only the items that the two sets have in common, $A\bigcap B$ would contain just eggs and milk.</br></br>{{% /answer %}}

## Counting
It might be hard to imagine, but people have not always had numbers. The numbers we use today are actually the result of thousands of years of innovation and invention.

Surprisingly, sets actually come before numbers. To see why this is the case, take a look at the following sets.  What do they have in common?

![](/img/chapter-1/sets_of_3.png#center)

These sets are similar because they are the same size.  Even though their contents are different, the *quantity* of items in each set is identical.  In other words, they have the same **number** of items.

It's this need to count the objects in a set that initiated the development of numbers.


##  Development of Numbers
Undoubtedly fingers were among the earliest counting tools.  In fact, the English the words *eleven* and *twelve* come from the Old English words for "one left over" and "two left over", indicating how many would be left after using all ten fingers.

Over time people developed other tools to help them keep track of their flocks, herds, and other commodities.  These ranged from simple tally marks on a stick to small tokens or figurines carved to look like sheep, goats, jars of oil, baskets of grain, and so on.{{% sidenote "tokens" %}}![](/img/chapter-1/tally_sticks.jpg) Tally sticks and tokens from the Swiss Alpine Museum. [*Photo by Sandstein.*](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SAM_PC_1_-_Tally_sticks_1_-_Overview.jpg){{% /sidenote %}}

Artifacts in Mesopotamia suggest that about 10,000 years ago the Sumerians started using clay tokens shaped to resemble the items they were exchanging, one token for each item.  Soon these tokens were replaced by drawing shapes on clay tablets.

Eventually symbols (*numerals*) were created for specific quantities which eliminated the need to make one mark for each item. It was at that point, around 5000 years ago, that the first number system was born.{{% sidenote "numerals" %}}![](/img/chapter-1/Sumerian_tablet.png) This 5000 year-old clay tablet is one of the first artifacts in history to display numerical symbols.

The Sumerian system did not look like the one we use today.  It used a base of 60 (which is why we have 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour) but only had symbols for "one", for "ten", and for "sixty".  To write  other values you repeated those symbols as needed.

The numbers we use today originated in India and were later adapted by Arab scholars. Because of it's origins our system is called the Hindu-Arabic system.

The Hindu-Arabic system has 3 key features:

1. It is a base-10 system, meaning only the ten symbols $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ are used.
1. The position of a digit determines its value. For example, the $2$ in $238$ stands for $2$-hundreds, the $3$ means $3$-tens and the $8$ is for $8$-ones.
1. $0$ is used both as a number and as a placeholder so that, for instance, $407$ can be visually distinguished from $47$.

It wasn't until the 15th and 16th centuries that Europe began to embrace Hindu-Arabic numerals. Subsequent colonization, commerce and scholarly communication have spread the system across the world.


## Natural Numbers and Integers
The numbers we are most familiar with are the counting numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, ...$.

The set of counting numbers is also known as the **natural numbers** and is represented by the symbol $\mathbb{N}$. In set notation we would say

$$\mathbb{N}=\\{1,2,3,...\\}.$$

You might already know that when we add two natural numbers the result is also a natural number. For example, $3$ and $5$ are both natural numbers and so is $3+5=8$.

But what if we subtract one natural number from another, is the result always in $\mathbb{N}$?  Clearly not, since subtraction can result in negative values.

The set that combines $\mathbb{N}$ with $0$ and all the negative natural numbers $\\{..., -3, -2, \\}$ is called the set of **integers** and is represented by the symbol $\mathbb{Z}$.

$$\mathbb{Z}=\\{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\\}.$$

We can add and subtract integers as much as we like and the result will always be an integer.

1. True or False:  If you *multiply* two integers you always get another integer.  {{% answer %}}**True**.  Since multiplication is repeated addition/subtraction, the answer will always be an integer.{{% /answer %}}
{{% /check %}}


## Rational Numbers
While multiplying two integers always results in another integer, division is more complicated.

If $p$ and $q$ are integers, then the fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ could be an integer, but it doesn't have to be. For instance $\frac{6}{2}=3$ is an integer, but $\frac{5}{2}$ is not.

The set that contains all the fractions, or ratios, of integers, is called the set of **rational numbers**, or $\mathbb{Q}$.

$$\mathbb{Q} = \left\lbrace \frac{p}{q}  \thinspace \bigg|  \thinspace {p} \text{ and } {q} \text{ are integers with } q\neq0 \right\rbrace.$$

Since division by $0$ is not well defined, ratios like $\frac{4}{0}$ and $\frac{-2}{0}$ are undefined and not included in the set of rational numbers.

Also notice that since any integer can be written as a fraction, the set of rational numbers includes all of the integers.

Rational numbers may be written as fractions or as decimals. The decimal expansion of a rational number will either terminate or eventually have a pattern that repeats forever, as these examples illustrate:
\[
\begin{align}
\frac{3}{16} &=0.1875 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal terminates}} \newline \newline
\frac{1}{3} &=0.\overline{3} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal repeats}} \newline \newline
\frac{1}{7} &=0.\overline{142857} && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal repeats}} \newline \newline
\frac{10}{5} &=2 && \small \color{#5fa2ce}{\text{decimal terminates}}
\end{align}
\]
The set of rational numbers is special because you can add, subtract, multiply and divide as much as you want and never end up with a different type of number---the answer will always be a rational number.

4. Write $\frac{3}{2} + \frac{5}{6}$ as a rational number.  {{% answer %}}Remember that to add fractions they must have the same denominator.  So first rewrite $\frac{3}{2}$ as $\frac{9}{6}$.  Then add and simplify.
\[
\begin{align}
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{5}{6} &= \frac{9}{6} + \frac{5}{6} \newline
 &= \frac{14}{6} \newline

 \]

5. Write $\frac{3}{2} \div \frac{5}{6}$ as a rational number. {{% answer %}}Dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal.  So
\[
\begin{align}
\frac{3}{2} \div \frac{5}{6} &= \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{6}{5} \newline
&= \frac{18}{10} \newline
&= \frac{9}{5}

## Real Numbers
Since the rational numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, it might come as a surprise that other types of numbers exist and are essential to mathematics.  The discovery of one new type of number is attributed to an associate of Pythagoras whose name was Hippasus of Metapontum.

According to legend, Hippasus was trying to measure the diagonal of a 1 by 1 square{{% sidenote "sqrt_2" %}}![](/img/chapter-1/sqrt_2.svg#center){{% /sidenote %}}.  He knew from the Pythagorean theorem that the answer was $\sqrt{2}$, but had been unable to find a rational number that was equal to $2$ when you square it.

Eventually he proved that $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be written as a ratio of any two integers and concluded that it must belong to a set of **irrational numbers**.

Some accounts say that the other Pythagoreans were so shocked by Hippasus' discovery that they drowned him in the Mediterranean Sea in an attempt to hide irrational numbers from the world.

Even though irrational numbers cannot be written as fractions, we can still represent them as decimals. The decimal expansion of an irrational number never ends and never repeats. For example, $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.414213562...$.

The union of the rational and irrational numbers is called the set of **real numbers**, $\mathbb{R}$.  In other words, the set of real numbers includes every type of number we've discussed so far.

For example, $-0.5$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\frac{7}{3}$, $-0.248$, and  $8.\overline{261}$ are all real numbers.

![](/img/chapter-1/real_numbers.png#center)

The set of real numbers is closed under all standard operations including powers and some roots.  In fact, you can do just about anything to a real number and the result will still be a real number, as long as you do not take the square root of a negative value, something we will look into in a later chapter.

{{% check %}}
1.  True or False:  $ 2^{3}+9.5-\frac{8}{\sqrt{2}}$ is a real number. {{% answer %}} **True**.  Since we did not divide by zero and did not take the square root of a negative, the result must be a real number.</br></br>{{% /answer %}}
2.  True or False:   $\frac{6}{81-3^4}$ is a real number.  {{% answer %}} **False**.  This is because $81-3^{4}=0$ and division by $0$ is not well defined.</br></br>{{% /answer %}}
3.  True or False:   $\sqrt{16-4(15)}$ is a real number.  {{% answer %}}**False**. Simplifying the values inside the square root gives $\sqrt{-44}$ and the square root of a negative number is **not** a real number.{{% /answer %}}

## The Real Number Line
It is often helpful to visualize the set of real numbers with a **number line**, which is nothing more than a straight line with marks representing the location of numbers.

![](/img/chapter-1/numberline_plain.svg#center)

Positive numbers are always on the right side of zero, negative numbers are always on the left, and arrows indicate that the line continues in both directions.

Every real number has a place on the number line, and every location on a number line is assumed to correspond to a real number.  Here are a few real numbers and their relative locations on the number line.

![](/img/chapter-1/numberline_real_numbers.svg#center)


## Intervals of Real Numbers
The set of all values in between two numbers is called an **interval**.  For instance, all of the numbers between $0$ and $3$ make an interval.

There are several ways to describe this interval.  One way is to use inequalities and write it as a set.

$$\lbrace x \thinspace \vert \thinspace 0<x<3  \rbrace$$

Another option is to color the interval on a numberline

![](/img/chapter-1/interval_open_0_to_3.svg#center)

Open circles indicate that the numbers $0$ and $3$ are **not** included in the interval.

A third option is to use **interval notation**, which is a written abbreviation of the number line.  In this example the interval notation would be

$$(0 , 3)$$

Notice that this mirrors the number line by having the lowest number on the left, with parenthesis taking the place of the open circles.

Other intervals might include an end point or even extend out toward infinity.  For example, the interval of all numbers greater than or equal to $2$ can be described in any of the following ways

* **set notation**: $$\lbrace x\vert-2\leq x<\infty  \rbrace$$
* **number line**: ![](/img/chapter-1/interval_closed_-2_to_infinity.svg#center)
* **interval notation**: $$[ -2\thinspace, \thinspace \infty)$$

There are a few subtleties here that deserved to be highlighted.  First, when an endpoint is included, (1) the inequality in set notation includes an equal sign, (2) the circle on the number line is filled in, and (3) the parenthesis in interval notation changes to a square bracket.

Second, to indicate that an interval continues out toward infinity we use an arrow pointing in the appropriate direction.  Since nothing equals infinity we must always use a parenthesis when writing that part of the interval.

## Combining Intervals
Since intervals are sets of real numbers, they can be combined using unions an intersections.

As before, the union is the all of the two intervals joined together, while the intersection is just where two intervals overlap each other.  A few examples will illustrate the idea.

Suppose we have the following intervals.  What will the **union** look like?  Move the **<font color="blue">blue</font>** slider to see the union.

{{% answer %}}The union of the two intervals is

Once we've identified the union on the number line, it's much easier to write it in interval notation.

$$(-1, \infty) \bigcup  [-3,0 ) = [-3, \infty)$$

The **intersection** of the same two intervals is smaller, since it is only where they overlap.  You can explore the intersection in the figure below.

{{% answer %}}The intersection of the two intervals is

## Order of operations
In elementary school students are often asked to add several numbers together, such as $4 + 10 + 5 = 19$.  What is seldom discussed is the fact that we can't technically add three numbers at once.  

Addition, like the other basic operations, is a "binary" operation--it only works on two numbers a time.  To avoid confusion, when multiple operations are needed there is a standard order that should be followed.

The order of operations we use today is sometimes remembered by the acronym P E MD AS, which stands for

1. **P**arentheses (including brackets and fraction bars)
1. **E**xponents (including roots)
1. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision
1. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction

 When several of these operations are combined, operations higher on the list should be dealt with before those lower on the list.  

 If an expression has more than one operation with equal priority (like multiplication and division) then you work with them from left to right.

Since they are not equal the statement must be false.  <br><br>The true statement would be $$(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$$ using distribution.{{% /answer %}}

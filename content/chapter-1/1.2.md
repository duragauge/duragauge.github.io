## Introduction
On a vending machine each button corresponds to a particular snack inside the machine. The item you get depends on the button you push. When you press the button for a soda the machine should dispense that soda, if it is functioning properly.

The linking of each button to only one snack is the idea behind a mathematical function.


## The Definition of a Function
While no single formal definition can capture the full extent of the function concept, it is still important to start with a working definition.  The following definition was developed in the early 1900's and is stated in terms of sets.

{{% definition %}}
A **function** is any rule that matches each element from one set to exactly one element in another set. The set of inputs is called the **domain** of the function while the **range** is the set of all its output values.
{{% /definition %}}

Notice that this definition has three parts: (1) the domain, (2) the range and (3) the rule that links them together.

If $x$ is in the domain and $y$ is in the range, then the function $f$ that links them together could be drawn as a mapping diagram, like the one below.

## Explore the Concept of a Function
Let's look at a specific example that illustrates the concept.  

Suppose three friends went to a deli and each ordered a sandwich, as in the diagram below.

![](/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_sandwiches_1.svg#center)

Since each person is linked to just one sandwich, this *is* a function.  A different arrangement may or may not represent a function.  

Anytime we can match each item from one set to just one item another set, then we have created a function.

In the figure below you can change the arrangement of the arrows by moving the **<font color="blue">blue</font>** points.  Experiment until you feel confident that you can recognize what is and what is not a function.

## Function Notation
When there is a function relationship between $x$ and $y$ it is common practice to replace $y$ with $f(x)$ and say that $y=f(x)$.  This is known as **function notation**.

![](/img/chapter-1/arrow_diagram_function_x_f_of_x.svg#center)

When said aloud the notation $f(x)$ is read "$f$ of  $x$".  This notation reminds us that the output $f(x)$ is the result of putting the input $x$ inside of the function $f$.   

In fact, it can be helpful to think of a function as a machine that changes an object $x$ into something new $f(x)$.

![](/img/chapter-1/function_machine.svg#center)

Suppose, for example, that pressing the button $\text{B4}$ on a vending machine gives you a bag of potato chips. Using function notation we might write $f(\text{B4})=\text{potato chips}$.

With function notation the choice of letters is completely arbitrary. For example, if a function always adds $3$ it makes no difference whether we refer to it as $f(x)=x+3$ or as $g(x)=x+3$ or as $w(t)=t+3$. It is what a function does that matters, not what it is called.


## Evaluating & Solving
The process of determining the output given a particular input is called **evaluating** the function. Evaluating is sometimes confused with solving, which is understandable since they are like two sides of a coin.  To **evaluate** we start with an input and find the output.  **Solving** is the reverse process, we are given an output and must find the input.

Consider the function shown in the table below.

| $x$ | $y=f(x)$ |
| ----- | ----- |
| $0$ | $4$ |
| $1$ | $0$ |
| $2$ | $-3$ |
| $3$ | $9$ |
| $4$ | $16$ |

To evaluate $f(3)$ we simply find the value of $y$ when $x=3$.  From the table it appears that $f(3)=9$.

To solve $f(x)=4$, however, we scan the table in the opposite direction, looking for an $x$ that creates $4$ as an output.  The solution is $x=0$.

If a function is defined by an equation, such as $f(x)=2 x^2 - 6 x$, then we evaluate it by replacing every $x$ with the given input value.  To find $f(10)$, we insert $10$ everywhere we see an $x$ and simplify, if possible.

\[
  \begin{align}
    f(10) &= 2(10)^2-6(10) \newline
    &= 200-60 \newline
    &= 140
  \end{align}
\]

We now know that $f(10)=140$.

A function can be evaluated even if we do not get a numerical result.  Evaluating $f(x^{2})$ or $f(t+2)$ would mean substituting each $x$ with the expression $x^{2}$ or $t+2$.

## Domain of a Function
Every time we identify a function we should also determine its domain.  Recall that the domain is the set of all input values.

If the function is defined by a table, a diagram or a list of points, then we can list every element of the domain explicitly, like we did in the sandwich example earlier.

When a function is defined by an equation we will assume, unless told otherwise, that the domain is every real number input that produces a real number output.  

For instance, if $f(x)=\sqrt{x} $ then the domain is any real number greater than or equal to zero, since square roots of negative values are not real numbers.  This can be written as an interval $[0,\infty)$ or with set-builder notation $\lbrace x \vert  x \ge 0 \rbrace $.

Similarly, the domain of $g(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ is every real number except zero, since division by zero is undefined.  Writing this as an interval is a bit tricky since we have to use a union:  $(-\infty,0)  \bigcup  (0,\infty)$.  With set-builder notation we simply say which $x$ values cannot be used: $ \lbrace x \vert  x \neq 0 \rbrace $.

As this example shows, it is often easiest to say what is not in the domain.  Specifically, we must always eliminate from the domain any numbers that result in division by zero and even roots of negative numbers.

1.  Explain why the domain of $f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2-9}$ is $ \lbrace x \vert x \neq \pm 3 \rbrace $. {{% answer %}}The denominator cannot equal zero, so $x$ cannot be $3$ or $-3$. Using interval notation the domain is $(-\infty,-3) \bigcup (-3, 3) \bigcup (3,\infty)$.  With set-builder notation we can write that a bit more compactly as { $ x  \vert  x\neq \pm 3 $ }.{{% /answer %}}
1.  What is the domain of $g(x)=\sqrt{x-5}$? {{% answer %}}To avoid taking the root of a negative number, $x-5>=0$, or $x \geq 5$.  Using interval notation the domain is $[5, \infty)$.  With set builder-notation it is ${x \vert  x \geq 5}$.{{% /answer %}}

## Representations of Functions
Because functions are so widely used, there are many different ways to represent them.  We have already encountered functions represented by mapping diagrams and equations.  We'll also see functions written as tables, sets of points, sequences of operations, and graphs.

Switching from one representation to another can help us see different features and discover connections that might have been hidden otherwise.   

Of primary importance will be the connection between a function defined by an equation and its graph.


## Graphs of Functions
The **graph** of a function is the set of all points $(x, y)$ where each $y$ is found by evaluating the function's equation, since $y=f(x)$.  

For instance, to graph the function $f(x)=x^{2}-3$ we randomly choose a handful of values for $x$ and evaluate the function for each one, creating a table of values.  

| $x$ | $f(x)=x^{2}-3$ |
| ----- | ----- |
|  $-2$ | $(-2)^2-3 = 1$ |
| $-1$ | $(-1)^2-3 =  -2$ |
| $0$ | $(0)^2-3 = -3$ |
| $1$ | $(1)^2-3 = -2$ |
| $2$ | $(2)^2-3 = 1$ |
| $3$ | $(3)^2-3 = 6$ |

Then we convert those values into ordered $(x, y)$ pairs

\[
  \left\lbrace (-2, 1),  (-1, -2),  (0, -3),  (1, -2),  (2, 1),  (3, 6) \right\rbrace
\]

that can be plotted and connected with a smooth curve.

Even though calculators and apps can graph most functions, graphing functions by hand is still an important skill to practice.

## The Vertical Line Test
It is important to remember that not every relationship or rule defines a function.  The key is that each input corresponds to just one output.  

In order for a graph to be a function each $x$ can only correspond to one $y$.  This means that no two points on the graph can share the same $x$-coordinate.   

A quick way to test this is to draw (or imagine drawing) several vertical lines through the graph.  If the graph is a function, then no vertical line will cross the graph more than once.  On the other hand, if any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph is not a function.  For obvious reasons, this test is called the **vertical line test**.

In each of the figures below there is a **<font color="blue">blue</font>** vertical line.  Apply the vertical line test to each graph by moving the vertical line across the graph.

{{% geogebra ratio="50%" id_1="00CO3ExUaQIoYDtH" id_2="dhf2es4y" id_m="r9g6gyym" %}}

The vertical line test is very useful, but we must make sure we can see the entire graph.

{{% check %}}
1.  Does the equation $y=2x-3$ define $y$ as a function of $x$?   {{% answer %}}Yes, each $x$ will create exactly one $y$ value.  And if we graph $y=x-3$ it clearly passes the vertical line test.<br>![](/img/chapter-1/function_graph_VLT_Quick_Check_1.svg#center){{% /answer %}}
1.  If $x+2y=4$, is $y$ a function of $x$?   {{% answer %}}Yes.  Rewriting the equation as $y=-1/2 x +2$ we see that each $x$ has exactly one corresponding $y$ value and the graph passes the vertical line test.<br>![](/img/chapter-1/function_graph_VLT_Quick_Check_2.svg#center){{% /answer %}}
1.  Use a graph to decide if the equation $x^2+y^2=3$ defines $y$ as a function of $x$. {{% answer %}}No, the graph  of $x^2+y^2=3$ is a circle, which would not pass the vertical line test.
<br>![](/img/chapter-1/function_graph_VLT_Quick_Check_3.svg#center)<br>
To graph $x^2+y^2=3$ on a calculator you would need to solve for $y$, which results in two equations.  The top half of the circle is $y=\sqrt{3-x^2}$ and the bottom half is $y=-\sqrt{3-x^2}$.  Looking at just one half might lead you to incorrectly assume that the equation is a function.{{% /answer %}}

## Evaluate Functions Using Graphs
When a function is defined by a graph we evaluate the function by reading off the $y$ coordinate that matches the given $x$ value.  Solving reverses the process-we find $x$ when given a specific $y$.

In the figure below you can move the **<font color="blue">INPUT</font>** $x$ value which will change the **<font color="red">OUTPUT</font>** $y$ value.  

{{% geogebra ratio="53.33%" id_1="7vUTOXYoQLp7HDaD" id_2="lQTU2l1r" id_m="lQTU2l1r" %}}

To evaluate $f(5)$, for example, move the **<font color="blue">INPUT</font>** to $x=5$ and read off the corresponding **<font color="red">OUTPUT</font>** on the $y$-axis.  In this case, $f(5)=4$.  

Solving is the reverse process.  As an example, to solve $f(x)=4$ for $x$ you move the  **INPUT** until the **OUTPUT** equals $4$.  Then you record the **INPUT**.  Here there are multiple values for $x$ that work: $x=1.7$, $x=4$, and $x=11.7$ all appear to give outputs of $4$, and would be valid solutions to $f(x)=4$.


## Looking Ahead
Until we gain familiarity with several different types of functions, it will be difficult to determine the range of a function by inspecting its equation.  We will have more success if we work with its graph instead.

We can learn a lot about a function from looking at its graph.  This will be the focus of the next section.  The overall goal is to categorize functions into families that share similar properties and characteristics.

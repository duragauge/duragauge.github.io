<!-- This short code puts Geogebra files inside of a responsive div so that they resize to match the viewing window for screens smaller than 736px wide.
Best fit is to design files with a width of 736px.  Then find the ratio of height/width and enter it as a percentage.
To find the Geogebra ID login, select Details and then Share.  Don't copy the entire url, just the ID.

This code sets the border color to #fafafa, which is the same as the background color of the pages.  If background color changes, should probably change the border color too.
Also makes sense to set the background color in Geogebra to the same thing, which is RGB 250,250,250.

** This is still not working exactly the way I want.
Best case: it should only scale Geogebra when the screen is smaller than the original width of the figure.

            Equations are written in LaTeX and rendered through MathJax. Interactive figures were crafted using GeoGebra, all other graphics were designed using Inkscape and Gimp. The site is built with Hugo using Markdown files, combining the forty theme and Tufte styles. Additional practice exercises are provided through <a href="https://www.myopenmath.com/">MyOpenMath</a>, a free homework system by David Lippman.
